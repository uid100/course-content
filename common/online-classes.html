        <h2>"Web" Distance-learning</h2>
        <p>By now, most of us have experienced online courses and you're probably wondering how this one is going to
            work.</p>
        <p>Like most of the courses you've probably experienced at this school, our course material will be contained
            here within the Canvas online system, and accessed through the school's website.</p>
        <h3>Important reminders:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>remote</em>, or <em>distance-learning</em> does not mean independent learning, and</li>
            <li>online does not mean <em>self-paced</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h4><em>"We are not alone."</em></h4>
        This course is what's known as an <em>asynchronous</em> course. That means that we will not have scheduled
        meetings, either online or face-to-face. people take online courses for a variety of reasons. Traditionally, the
        primary factor was schedule flexibility, to work around work or family schedules. More recently of course a
        global health crisis changed the way people live and work. Working and going to school remotely didn't begin
        with the pandemic, but it certainly became more common and more accepted.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are benefits to being online from whatever location works best for you, but there are also down-sides.
            When studying a technical subject, there may be times of frustration when things just aren't making sense,
            and in spite of what I'm telling you, you'll look around your workspace and feel very alone. You are not.
            There is a Canvas discussion board to ask (and answer!) questions to and from other students.</p>
        <p>This term, I do keep consistent but remote office hours with Zoom conferencing. See the syllabus for
            the times for this course. I do travel from time to time, but all times listed are the same timezone as the
            college. It is my sincere hope that these times will fit with your schedule. I can usually arrange another
            time to meet if you give me enough advance notice.</p>
        <p>Office hours are hosted in Zoom. These are completely optional, and not planned, or structured lessons or
            lectures. These are open sessions and students are invited to connect and bring your questions and issues
            with the projects that you have. Students will guide the discussion and I will be available to provide
            answers and explanations. Students are encouraged to answer eachother's questions also. Be aware, due to the
            open nature of these meetings, if you have a question of a more individual or personal nature, I will work
            with you to schedule an alternate meeting time.</p>
        <p>Please note, these are scheduled one hour blocks, but as long as I have no schedule conflict, These
            discussions may frequently go on longer. On the other hand, on those occasions that noone connects to the
            meeting, I may close the meeting after waiting for 20-30 minutes.</p>
        <h4><em>Not self-paced</em></h4>
        <p>The school has scheduled a block of time and resources for each class to complete a set of learning
            objectives. It should be no surprise that there are many factors considered in that scheduling. Likewise,
            each course is divided into smaller pieces of achievable blocks of learning and, like in our case, these
            build on each other.</p>
        <p>By keeping up with the schedule as designed, there is time to complete the assignments, and I have time to
            grade them and get feedback to you for next time.</p>
