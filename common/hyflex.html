                <p>HyFlex classes are taught on campus at scheduled days and times like a traditional class. Unlike a traditional class, HyFlex teachers use Zoom to broadcast their live class session. This means that in most cases students can CHOOSE whether to attend class on campus or via Zoom.</p>
                <p>Some teachers require in-person attendance for some class sessions, so check with the instructor for attendance requirements. Some teachers may also record the Zoom class sessions to share with students enrolled in the class.</p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                So, how's this going to work?</p>
            <p>
                I have taught classes, <strong>this course in fact</strong>, both online and in the classroom.</p>
            <p><strong>HyFlex</strong>, is an aggregation of the words <em>hybrid</em> and <em>flexible</em>. This means that as a hybrid course, it is intended to be taught both in the classroom and simultaneously online <em>via</em> <strong>Zoom</strong> conference, and allows the flexibility for students to attend either.</p>
            <p>I understand that there are circumstances which may prevent students from getting to campus, for example transportation, schedule commitments, and geography. This approach is meant to allow access to opportunities that students might not otherwise have.</p>
            <p>If you can attend class, please do. If you cannot, then you are welcome to join remotely.</p>
            <h3>Requirements</h3>
            <p>For remote participation, the requirements for joining are the same as for any Zoom video-conferencing experience that you have had.</p>
            <p>A Camera and Microphone are strongly recommended and at a minimum, you will need to be able and prepared to interact with the class with your computer. Do not login and <em>disappear</em>. Not being in class does not mean you will not be expected to engage.</p>

            <h3>Attendance</h3>
            <p>From reading the syllabus, you have seen that there is no grade for attendance or even class participation. Student success is measured from learning the material and demonstrating understanding through the quizzes and exercise assignments.</p>
            <p>The material for this course is all contained in the Canvas server pages and augmented by textbook and resource links listed there. I believe the content is valuable, relevant to the industry, and that the course presents a worthwhile learning environment. I have invested a lot of time to try to compile the material in a way that is clear, complete, and concise.</p>
            <p>Yes. I am saying that there is no requirement to attend class, and I won't take it personally if you decide not to. This is <em>your</em> class. Succeeding in this class is <em>your</em> responsibility. It is my job to help you do that.</p>
            <p>I will track class attendance, both in-class and online for my own metrics, but there aren't points for sitting in a chair or logging into a video conference.</p>
            <p>There are, of course benefits to attending the lecture. I am the one who is grading your work. It makes sense that you'd want to hear directly from me about expectations and specific instructions, and be able to direct your questions directly to me in advance of submitting your work.</p>
            <h3><em>Lack of</em> Attendance</h3>
            <p>Pay attention to the attendance section in the syllabus. Although you won't earn or lose points for attendance, Canvas does log student activity within the system. Missing assignments, and lack of engagement with the class resources, may result in being dropped from the class for 'excessive absence.'</p>
