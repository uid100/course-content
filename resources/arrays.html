                        <h3>First, Arrays are a variable type</h3>
                        <p>
                            An array is a fundamental data structure in programming that 
                            allows you to store a collection of elements of the same type 
                            under a single variable name. Arrays are commonly used for 
                            organizing and manipulating data efficiently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yes, an array can hold a collection and all the other things 
                            that you may have heard about arrays, but first and foremost,
                            an array is a <strong>variable type</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recall what you know about variables, this means 
                            that an array must have a known size and set of rules, and it 
                            must address a location in memory.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            All elements of an array must be the same type (and size!), and 
                            the number of elements must be known when it is declared. When 
                            the compiler identifies the space required for any variable, it 
                            needs to know how much space is required.
                        </p>
                        <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 1em;">
                        <h4 style="font-style: italic;">
                            An array is stored in <strong>contiguous</strong> memory
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            The application will map any variable to an actual location in 
                            memory. Arrays are no different.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong><em>Contiguous</em></strong> not <em>continuous</em>!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Contiguous memory means that the memory allocated for an
                            array is a single block of memory, where each element is stored
                            in a sequential manner, one after the other, without any gaps
                            or interruptions.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-style: italic;">
                            Continous means there is no end --ever. That would be amazing!
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The address of an array maps to the start of the block of memory
                            reserved to store its data.
                        </p>
                        <p>Since each element is the same size 
                            (type), if the first element is stored at the start of the block, 
                            finding the second one is simply a matter of moving through the 
                            memory, past exactly the size of the first element. Getting to 
                            the third means starting from the beginning and going past the 
                            first two (2) elements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We call this the index of the array element. So, <code>myArray[5]</code> 
                            is referring to an element located past the first 5 items counted 
                            from the beginning of the memory block, or the sixth element.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>myArray[5]</code> contains the sixth element of the array.

                        <p>
                            It seems that I have this discussion with colleagues almost
                            every year. I've been told that <em>hardware-guys</em> count
                            from one, but <em>software-guys</em> count from zero.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And yet, when I hold up my hand and ask how many fingers I am 
                            holding up, I get the same answer from both groups.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I maintain that this is nonsense. We, collectively, all count 
                            from the first element as <em>one</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Don't make this more complicated than it needs to be.

                        <p>
                            An array index, or subscript, is a <em>memory offset</em> from 
                            the starting memory address.
                        </p>
                        <img src="/course-content/images/array.png" style="margin:auto; margin-bottom: 1em;"

                        <p>
                            Consider the image. On a whiteboard, I can easily demonstrate 
                            moving from the first element to the second and so on. But if 
                            you think about it, this is not a very efficient way for a computer
                            to find something in memory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead of "moving" to the first element, and "counting" to the 
                            next, the computer can simply calculate the address by taking
                            the base address and adding the size of the element, since they're
                            all the same size, and multipying by the index to get the offset.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Consider an array of integers, each 4 bytes in size:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the array is at address <code>0x1000</code>, mapped by the 
                            variable name, like any other variable. Then the first element
                            is at that address plus zero times the size of the elements
                            (4 bytes), so zero bytes. So the first element is at
                             <code>0x1000</code>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second element is at <code>0x1000 + (1 * 4) = 0x1004</code>, 
                            and the third element is at <code>0x1000 + (2 * 4) = 0x1008</code>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But the computer doesn't have to "count" to find the item. To get
                            to the two-hundred and thirteenth element, <code>arr[212]</code>,
                            the computer simply calculates the offset: 212 times the size of
                            the element, which is 4 bytes, and adds that to the base address.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So when you see an <strong>array index</strong>, or subscript, it is
                            simply a memory <strong>offset</strong> from the base address of the
                            array.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">
                            Index = offset
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And, understanding this, you can go back to counting from one, like 
                            the rest of us.

                        <p>
                            Arrays are declared by specifying the data type of the elements 
                            they will contain, followed by the array name and the size of 
                            the array (number of elements).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Why?</em> Because the application has to know how much space 
                            it needs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The size of the array must be known when it is declared. Since 
                            we have to have a contiguous block of memory, the size cannot 
                            change after the array is declared.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you need to have more elements later, the computer will not
                            add size to the array. Instead it will create a new array in another
                            location that is the correct size, copy the elements from the
                            old array to the new one, and then delete the old array.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Understanding how the computer accesses the elements, makes this 
                            clearer. If the computer had to jump around in memory to find the 
                            next element, items would be slower to access or be lost.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Assigning Values to Arrays</h3>
                        <p>
                            Once declared, you can assign values to individual elements of the 
                            array using indexing. Indexing starts at 0 for the first element and 
                            goes up to the size of the array minus one.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Storing and Retrieving Elements</h3>
                        <p>
                            Elements in an array are stored sequentially in memory, allowing for 
                            fast access based on their index. You can retrieve elements by 
                            specifying their index within square brackets.
                        </p>

                            Arrays provide a convenient and efficient way to work with 
                            collections of data in programming, making them a valuable tool 
                            for various tasks.

                            These rules for how to create and use arrays are important, 
                            but if you understand how arrays work, then the <em>why</em> 
                            they work will make sense, and the rules will make more sense.
                        </p>

                            Later, you will learn about other data structures that
                            can be used to store collections of data, such as lists, sets,
                            and dictionaries. Each of these has its own rules and uses, but
                            they all share the same fundamental concept of storing data in a
                            structured way, and understanding arrays will help you
                            grasp these other data structures more easily.
