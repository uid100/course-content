<h2>Installing Visual Studio</h2>
<p>
    This is a simple step-by-step walk through to get<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Visual Studio
        2022</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>up and running on your<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Window</strong>s computer. If
    you are running another operating system, you'll may have more work to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <strong>Microsoft Visual Studio</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is an Integrated Development Environment
    (<strong>IDE</strong>).
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Integrated&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Development</li>
    <li>Environment</li>
</ul>
<p>
    More than just an editor, or a compiler, or a code interpreter, or a debugger, or a configuration manager, or a
    database manager, or cloud deployment engine, or web application server. The IDE has those capabilities and more.
    The more you become familiar with the tools, the more useful they become. The good news is that you don't have to
    know about all of them to start using them and we'll walk through and gain insight as they become more familiar and
    comfortable.</p>

<h3>Community Edition</h3>
<p>
    The Community Edition is a feature-rich toolset that is free to use for students and individual developers. Other
    licensed environments are available to larger enterprises. If you are installing for personal use, this is it!</p>

            <li>It's time to get up and stretch. Read Chapters 1 from your textbook, maybe get a cup of coffee</li>
            <li>I've seen this install process take anywhere between 30 minutes&nbsp; or&nbsp; 2 hours. For these
                screenshots, I took a lightly used machine, uninstalled 3 different previous installations of Visual
                Studio to start a clean build, and it took close to 45 minutes for the installation</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the product is installed, it will ask you to log in to Visual Studio. If you have a login that you already use
    on Microsoft Azure, you can use that. If you don't know what this is, then you can skip for now.</p>
