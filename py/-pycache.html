            __pychache__: <i>What's this?</i>
        </h1>

        <p>
            A question was asked in my email about this mysterious folder that appears in your project directory
            after running Python code. The folder is called "__pychache__".

            What is it? Why is it there? Can I delete it?
        </p>

            As you have seen, when you run Python code, it runs in the interpreter and each command can be executed
            one line at a time. From this perspective, it is easy to see that Python is an interpreted language.
        </p>
        <p>
            But that is only part of the story.
        </p>
        <p>
            Python is also a compiled language. When you run Python code, the Python interpreter compiles the code
            into bytecode. This bytecode is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).
        </p>
        <p>
            If the code is to be imported for use in another program, the bytecode is saved in the "__pychache__"
            folder. If the folder does not exist, Python will create it. The file is compiled and saved to a file with a
            .pyc extension. The compiled code is also tagged with the version of Python that was used to compile it.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, when I added my <coded>Methods.py</coded> file and imported it to another file, the bytecode
            was saved in the "__pychache__" folder as <code>Methods.cpython-313.pyc</code>. Since I am using the latest
            version of Python, which is currently 3.13, the file is tagged with "313".
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the bytecode is saved in the "__pychache__" folder, it is not necessary to recompile the code each
            time it is imported. This makes the code run faster.

            So, the "__pychache__" folder is a good thing. It makes your code run faster.

            Can you delete it? What happens if you do?
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, you can delete the "__pychache__" folder. If you do, Python will recompile the code each time it is
            imported.
            This will slow down the execution of your code, in most cases not very much, but it will slow it down.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are actively developing those imported module files, the code will be be recompiled each time you
            import it
            since it is being <i>saved</i> with a new timestamp. If you are actively working on a large project with a
            lot of files,
            it may be a good idea to delete the "__pychache__" folder once in a while to ensure that all of your code is
            recompiled
            and up-to-date.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are working on a small project, it is probably not necessary to delete the "__pychache__" folder.
        </p>

        <p style="font-style: italic;">
            Do I need to include these files when I submit the assignment?
        </p>
        <p>
            The answer is it really doesn't matter. If they are not there, they will be when I review and run the code.
            If they are included, it also will not make a difference. They may be deleted and recreated during code
            review anyway.
        </p>
