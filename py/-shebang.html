                                The Python interpreter directive, often referred to as a "shebang" or "hashbang," is a
                                special line placed at the very beginning of a Python script. It's a comment, but a
                                special one, recognized and interpreted by the operating system, not the Python
                                interpreter itself. Its primary purpose is to tell the system which interpreter should
                                be used to execute the script. This is particularly important in Unix-like environments
                                (Linux, macOS) where multiple versions of Python might be installed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The directive takes the form <code>#! /path/to/python_interpreter</code>. The
                                <code>#!</code> signifies that it's a shebang, and
                                <code>/path/to/python_interpreter</code> specifies the absolute path to the desired
                                Python executable. For example, <code>#!/usr/bin/python3</code> instructs the system to
                                use the Python 3 interpreter located at <code>/usr/bin/python3</code>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This ensures that the correct Python interpreter is used to run the script, regardless
                                of the user's current environment or default Python version. This avoids potential
                                compatibility issues and ensures consistent script execution. Without it, the system
                                might try to execute the script using a different Python version, potentially leading to
                                errors or unexpected behavior.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A more flexible and recommended approach is to use <code>/usr/bin/env</code>.
                            </p>

                        <h5 class="card-title">Example: Using /usr/bin/env</h5>

                                Instead of hardcoding the absolute path to a specific Python interpreter, using
                                <code>#!/usr/bin/env python3</code> is generally preferred. This approach leverages the
                                <code>env</code> command, which searches the user's <code>PATH</code> environment
                                variable for the first executable named <code>python3</code>. This offers several
                                advantages:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Portability:</b> Different systems might have Python 3 installed in different
                                    locations. <code>/usr/bin/env</code> searches the <code>PATH</code>, so the script
                                    will likely work across different systems as long as Python 3 is in the
                                    <code>PATH</code>.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Virtual Environments:</b> When working with virtual environments, each
                                    environment typically has its own Python interpreter. Activating a virtual
                                    environment modifies the <code>PATH</code> to include the environment's Python
                                    executable. Using <code>/usr/bin/env python3</code> ensures that the correct Python
                                    interpreter within the active virtual environment is used.</li>
                                <li><b>Flexibility:</b> If you have multiple Python 3 versions installed, you can manage
                                    which one is used by adjusting your <code>PATH</code>. This provides more control
                                    than hardcoding a specific path.</li>
