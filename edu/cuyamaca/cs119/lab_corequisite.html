        <h2>Program Design & Development</h2>
        <h3>CS 119 lecture</h3>
        <blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
            This is an introductory course in program design and development using an object-oriented
            programming language to serve as a foundation for more advanced [...computer science...]
            courses.
        </blockquote>
        <h3>CS 119 lab</h3>
        <blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
            Laboratory tutorials, drills and programming problems designed to help students master the concepts
            and programming projects presented/assigned in CS 119.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Students must be enrolled in the lecture and lab components of this course.</p>
        <ul>
            Assessments are through:
            <li>Online Discussion Participation</li>
            <li>Chapter Quizzes</li>
            <li>Demonstration and Practical Exercises</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These courses are tightly integrated and are treated as a single cohesive class. The
            curriculum for both course sections are hosted in a single Canvas course, enabling students to
            access the content in a single location. The lab component is designed to provide students with
            hands-on experience with the concepts and programming projects presented in the lecture component.
            The combined grade is based on the student's performance in both the lecture and lab components.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neither course is intended to be taken alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            The activities in the lab component are designed to reinforce the concepts and used to demonstrate
            understanding through practical application.
        </p>
        <p>
            The college registration system does not allow students to enroll in the lecture without also enrolling
            in the lab component.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <div id="exception" style="font-style: italic; padding:30px;">
            <h3>Lab-only Exceptions</h3>
            <p>
                There are exceptional cases, where concessions have been made for transfer students who have already
                completed the lecture component at another institution, that still require the 1-unit lab component to
                complete a degree requirement. Students in this situation may petition the department chair for an
                exception.
            </p>
            <p>
                This also requires manual intervention by the registrar to allow the student to enroll in the lab.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students enrolled in the lab component without the lecture component will have the same access to
                the same combined course materials and are welcome and encouraged to participate and attend lectures
                and optional online discussions, but grades will only be assessed on the lab exercises.
