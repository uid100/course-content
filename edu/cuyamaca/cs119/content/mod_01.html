                        <p>Welcome to the course! I am looking forward to working with you this semester.

                                In polite society, we meet and introduce ourselves. It's not a bad thing.<br />
                                And I have a Discussion board set up just for that purpose. (<em>Hey, you get 
                                    points for it!</em>).<br /><em>This one is a little different, please read

                        <p>
                            My career began in research. In that environment, I was primarily responsible 
                            for finding creative solutions for real world data collection and analysis in 
                            challenging environments. Sometimes it meant writing software for instrument 
                            control and data processing on a small ship rolling in heavy seas. Sometimes 
                            I was building cabinets, designing and creating electrical and plumbing 
                            solutions for a mobile shipboard lab facility. Sometimes it was negotiating 
                            with shipping agents and import/export documentation in foreign ports. Always, 
                            it involved a changing set of requirements, analysis, design, and implementation.</p>
                        <p>
                            Moving into the private sector, I ran IT departments for large banking operations, 
                            again looking for creative solutions to apply emerging technologies.</p>
                        <p>
                            Then, for many more years, I worked as a systems engineer and later project and 
                            program manager for large government contractors.</p>
                        <p>
                            Project management and systems engineering have different perspectives and approaches 
                            but they have many shared objectives. In this course, we will explore the end-to-end 
                            activities that are part of software solution development.</p>
                        <p>
                            Although each of the student projects will be individual efforts, collaboration will 
                            be an important part of the experience also.</p>

                            <h4>Classroom Meetings</h4>
                            <p>
                                We will meet in class each week according to the course schedule. Please be 
                                on time and treat our classroom as the professional environment that it is. 
                                See syllabus for more.</p>
                            <p>
                                Assignments and quizzes are due each week. See the schedule for dates. The 
                                materials for each module will be available by the start of each week, and 
                                I will try and make them available sooner. You should read the chapter and 
                                start the exercises for each module before class. I will be going over the 
                                materials, walking through examples, and answering questions, but you will 
                                get more out of the class if it is not your first time seeing the material.</p>
                            <p>
                                Complete your assignments and get them submitted on time. It is my goal to 
                                get your projects graded before the class meeting the next week so that I 
                                can answer questions about them. I can't guarantee that late assignments 
                                will be graded. Late and missing assignments are not fair to me, to you, 
                                or to other students who are turning them in on time. See the syllabus for 
                                more details about my policy on late work.</p>

                            This course is designed to be very much a <em>hands-on</em> experience. Try and 
                            search for solutions when you run into challenges and try to apply them. There 
                            will be some reading and some videos to explain finer points of solutions 
                            development, and more importantly there will be opportunities to design and 
                            create.</p>

                        <h3>Canvas Modules</h3>
                        <p>
                            The course <i>container</i> here on Canvas is divided into modules corresponding 
                            to each chapter of the book. During each module, we will be covering the material 
                            from that chapter. Some of the modules will be completed in one week, some are 
                            scheduled across two weeks.</p>
                        <p>
                            You can see the schedule, module-by-module, and week-by-week at the bottom of the 
                            Syllabus. It is also summarized on the course home page or you can view the detail 
                            on the Canvas calendar.</p>
                        <p>
                            Keep track of the schedule for labs and quizzes. These are worth points! You are 
                            responsible for assignment due dates posted in Canvas. Nobody will chase you to 
                            turn in assignments.</p>
                        <p>
                            In each chapter module, you will find learning resources such as PowerPoint slides, 
                            lecture notes, videos, sample Python code for many of the chapters, and links to 
                            assignments such as labs and quizzes. This week, we will be covering chapter 1 of 
                            the textbook.</p>
                        <p>
                            Being the first week of class, much of our activity this week is going to be 
                            orientation stuff like the syllabus, outline and lab standards, getting the textbook, 
                            downloading/installing the Python IDLE on your own personal computers and we will 
                            jump into chapter 1 of the textbook.</p>
                        <p class="ic-flash-info">
                            The first week of class might seem overwhelming (and long!) but hang in there.</p>

                        <h3>Notes and Resources</h3>
                        <p>
                            The goal of each module is to make available to you a variety of learning resources 
                            and give you an organized list of materials to help you master each chapter. Everybody 
                            learns differently so I'm going to leave it mostly up to you to choose and use the 
                            materials that help you learn best.</p>
                        <p>
                            The Power Point slides are from the publisher and correspond to the textbook. Many 
                            people find these slides helpful as a study guide for the chapter and for taking 
                            notes. The quizzes and exams will follow the textbook.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>John Gerstenberg</strong> also teaches at Cuyamaca College and is the original 
                            author for much of the course content. I have included his lecture notes for each 
                            chapter. He emphasizes important concepts in the chapter, clarify tricky/difficult 
                            concepts and provides some sample Python code both to illustrate the chapter concepts 
                            and to save you the expense of buying a Python textbook. I've included these for you 
                            as an additional and valuable resource to help study or review the chapter and to help 
                            apply the information to the lab assignment.</p>
                        <p>
                            There are also assorted videos for each chapter that provide an additional learning 
                            resource, and links to various Python programming resources in the Python Help, 
                            Tutorials and Resources module.</p>
                        <p>
                            There may be helpful links on the #resources channel on Discord also, as well as 
                            friendly people to help answer questions. See the Discord link on the front page 
                            and the syllabus to join my server and online class discussions.</p>

                            If this is your first time taking any kind of programming course, don't panic - 
                            you're in the right place! It may not seem like it at times but really, you are. 
                            Learning a programming language is much like learning a foreign language or 
                            learning to play a musical instrument. The key and secret is practice! You have 
                            to immerse yourself and get involved hands-on. Simply trying to skim the chapter 
                            or a quick look at the sample code isn't going to do you a whole lot of good.</p>

                        <p>
                            In almost every lab assignment, there will be at least one guided programming 
                            exercise designed to prepare you for completing the remaining lab exercises.</p>
                        <p>
                            We will work on these together in class but you are encouraged to work them on 
                            your own ahead of time and bring your questions and share your experience.</p>

                            Last, but not least, let's dive into the first chapter of the textbook.</p>
                        <p>
                            Chapter 1 provides a brief overview of programming concepts in general. 
                            If the material doesn't make sense right away, don't panic.</p>
                        <p>
                            In short, this chapter (briefly) introduces just about everything we will 
                            be covering in greater depth in the later chapters. In chapter 2, we will 
                            dig deeper into developing the logic for an application and building a fully 
                            functional Python application.</p>
                        <p>
                            Start with the book. Read the chapter. Consider watching the videos. These 
                            were prepared by the book's author. Next review John's lecture notes. And 
                            finally review the PowerPoint slides.</p>
                        <p>This is the best way to study for the quizzes.</p>

                        <p>Yes. There are probably some. This is an evolving course and much of what you are seeing is very much a work in progress. If you have questions or find something that just doesn't make sense, it may well be that something is missing, incorrect, images not appearing, broken links, or something that could just be clearer. Please let me know.</p>
