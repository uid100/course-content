                            So much of what we do every day requires decisions and <em>sequential</em> logic

                            Park your car &gt; turn off the engine &gt;
                            remove the key &gt; take off your seatbelt &gt; gather your things &gt;
                            open the car door &gt; get out of the car &gt; close the car door &gt;
                            IF the car is outside, THEN lock the car &gt; walk to the front door &gt;
                            IF the front door is locked AND you have a key, unlock the door, ELSE knock on the door and wait
                            for someone to open it &gt; walk inside &gt; IF it is dark, THEN turn on the lights.</p>
                        <p>Of course this is a lot of detail that you don't need to think about all the time, maybe "go home"
                            is enough to be understood.</p>

                            When you stop and consider, you will realize that everything you do all day is a series of things,
                            and many of them are intentionally ordered in a logical sequence.</p>
                        <p>
                            Maybe you have driven to an appointment, walked from your car and across a parking lot and up a
                            set of stairs and remembered that you forgot something in your car. The logic demands that you
                            consider this new data and make a decision. You can go to the appointment without <em>the thing,</em>
                            or walk back to the car and get it and come back, or walk back to the car and make another decision,
                            maybe the walk was too far, and either move your car closer, or call and reschedule the appointment
                            for another day.</p>

                        <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
                        <p><em>Pseudo</em> is an adjective which means false or immitation.</p>
                        <p>
                            A farmer might take an old set of worn out work clothes, stuff them with straw, add a hat and stand
                            it up in a field. A <em>scarecrow</em> is a <em>pseudo-</em>farmer, or an imitation person intended
                            to frighten away birds to keep them from eating the farmers crops. It cannot do the work of a farmer,
                            it is not intended to fool anyone into thinking it is anything more than what it is, but for the
                            purpose of scaring crows, it is adequate and more efficient than hiring an extra farm-hand to stand
                            next to the fence all day scaring away the birds.</p>
                        <p>
                            Pseudocode is the simple expression of a logical <em>sequence</em> of steps that a process will take
                            to complete a task. It is not intended to <em>fool</em> anyone into thinking that it is actual code.
                            It is not meant to be executable by a computer it is simply the logical steps expressed in simple
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>For example, you might read the statement:</p>
                        <pre style="margin: 30px;">if(x&gt;y){y++}</pre>
                        <p style="font-style: italic; padding: 30px;">if open parenthesis letter 'x' pointing to letter 'y', close
                            parenthesis, and then add letter 'y' two times.</p>
                        <p>In most <em>C</em>-style languages (C/C++/C#/Java), this is a logical and acceptable statement. Some of
                            you might already know that it really means:</p>
                        <p style="font-style: italic; padding: 30px;">"if the value of x is greater than the value of y, then add
                            1 to the value of y."</p>
                        <p>By now you know that the first is <em>sourcecode</em> the second is <em>pseudocode.</em></p>

                        <p>
                            Pseudocode should contain clear, simple terms. Imagine you were sharing it with your grandmother or
                            the random person on the street. If they try to read it and have questions about what it means, it
                            might not be clear enough.</p>
                        <p>
                            To put it more simply, <em>pseudocode</em> is just the logical description of the sequential processing
                            steps.

                        <p>There are three parts to this.</p>
                        <h3>1. About you (15 points)</h3>
                        <p>
                            Share a little bit about ourselves; things like what you currently do, your major, 
                            why you are taking this class, what you would like to do after you finish your 
                            degree, hobbies, special interests, where you're originally from, where you live 
                            (general area), family, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your post should have at least one or two good paragraphs so others in the class 
                            can find some things in common with you. Take this as an opportunity to get to 
                            know others in the class and make some new friends with people who enjoy some of 
                            the same things you enjoy (I.e., music, video games, travel, hiking, sports, etc.).
                        </p>
                        <h3>2. A typical day (15 points)</h3>
                        <p>
                            List at least 10 <em>things</em> that you might do in a typical day (these can be 
                            real or completely made up.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Number the items on the list in the order that they <strong>must</strong> be 
                            completed. Add IF statements (conditional) if they should be there. Do any of the 
                            items get repeated and if so, is it a fixed number of times, or until something 
                            changes? <em> Wash and rinse the car exactly 3 times, or wash and rinse the car 
                            until it is clean enough? </em></p>
                        <p style="background-color: yellow; text-align: center;">
                            Parts 1 and 2 must be completed by 1159PM, the day before the due date so 
                            that others can reply.</p>
                        <h3>3. Replies (10 points + 10 points)</h3>
                        <p>
                            After your initial post, find and share things you have in common with at least 
                            two other students who posted. Could you relate to their <em>typical day</em>?</p>
                        <p>
                            Replies should be thoughtful, positive, and respectful.</p>
