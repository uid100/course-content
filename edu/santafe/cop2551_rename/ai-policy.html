    <dt>Use of AI Tools</dt>
    <dd>
        This policy applies to all coursework, including assignments, projects, and exams,
        ensuring students develop critical skills while maintaining academic integrity.
    </dd>
    <dt>Permitted Uses</dt>
    <dd>
        AI tools may be used to assist with learning programming concepts, debugging, improving code readability,
        correcting syntax, and enhancing documentation. Their role should be supplemental, helping students deepen their
        understanding and refine their own work.
    </dd>
    <dt>Prohibited Uses</dt>
    <dd>
        AI tools must not be used to submit unmodified AI-generated work, assist with exams or quizzes unless explicitly
        allowed, or facilitate unauthorized collaboration. Misuse undermines the learning process and is considered
        academic misconduct.
    </dd>
    <dt>Disclosure and Accountability</dt>
    <dd>
        Students must disclose any use of AI tools in their coursework and provide proper attribution for AI-assisted
        code. Instructors may require explanations to ensure students understand the material and the code they submit.
    </dd>
    <dt>Violations and Consequences</dt>
    <dd>
        Misuse of AI tools will be treated as academic misconduct, with penalties including reduced grades, assignment
        nullification, or further disciplinary action per institutional policies.
    </dd>
    <dt>Faculty and Student Best Practices</dt>
    <dd>
        Students should use AI tools as learning aids, not shortcuts, while faculty should provide clear guidelines on
        acceptable use. Assignments should prioritize critical thinking and originality over AI reliance.
