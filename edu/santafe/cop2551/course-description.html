    This course is a continuation of structured programming concepts using
    the C# programming language. This includes techniques for algorithm
    development, coding, and testing. This course will delve into forms,
    controls, and events using event-driven programming concepts. Students
    will develop programming solutions to reinforce new concepts and
    material presented in each chapter.

    Each chapter will be in a module that may contain lecture notes,
    PowerPoint slides for note taking, videos and code demonstrations that
    illustrate/apply the chapter concepts. Additionally, you will find links
    to any quizzes or other assignments for the chapter.
