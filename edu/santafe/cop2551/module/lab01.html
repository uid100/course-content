                            <p>
                                Before starting on any lab work for this class, take a few minutes to create a folder
                                structure for your labs like the one shown below. Being organized is a critical survival
                                skill in software development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you are using the classroom lab computers, be sure to create this on your USB drive
                                and be sure to save to it! Saving on the C: drive of the lab computers is a disaster
                                waiting to happen!

                                Notice that the folders are numbered "lab01", "lab02", and so on. If you number
                                these using only a single digit, then when we labs 10, 11, and 12, the natural
                                ordering of your folders will be lab1, lab10, lab11, lab12, lab2, lab3, ...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is because the computer sorts the folders in "alphabetical" order, not
                                "numerical" order. So, lab1 comes before lab10, and lab2 comes after lab10.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To avoid this problem, use 2 digit numbers for the lab folders. This way, when we
                                get to lab10, the folders will be sorted in the correct order: lab01, lab02, lab03,
                                lab04, lab05, lab06, lab07, lab08, lab09, lab10, lab11.

                                    <p>
                                        Open the <code>Program.cs</code> file in the editor. You will see a lot of code
                                        that you did not write. This is the code that was generated for you by Visual
                                        Studio.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Notice there are three "blocks" of code in the file.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The first block is the <em>namespace</em>. It is named the same as the project.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Inside this, the second block is the <em>class</em> <code>Program</code>. This
                                        is
                                        the
                                        main class of the program. It contains the <em>entry point</em> of the program
                                        and
                                        it
                                        is contained in the <code>namespace</code>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The third block is the <em>method</em> <code>Main()</code>. This is the main
                                        method
                                        of the program. It is where the program starts executing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When you run the program, it will execute the code in the <code>Main()</code>
                                        method
                                        and print the output, currently "Hello World!" to the console.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Use the editor to replace all the code with the following:
                                    </p>

                                        The comments are there to explain what the code is doing. You can remove them if
                                        you
                                        want. The <code>using System;</code> line is a directive that tells the compiler
                                        to
                                        use the System namespace. This is where the Console class is defined.

                                        Our simple program will prompt for two numbers. The result of multiplying the
                                        two
                                        numbers is called the <em>product.</em>

                                    <p>
                                        Use of <code>number1</code>, <code>number2</code>, and <code>product</code> are
                                        examples of <em>variables</em> with intentional names. The names are descriptive
                                        and
                                        meaningful. They are not just random letters or numbers. This is a good
                                        programming
                                        practice.

                                        Run the program by clicking the green arrow (Start button) in the toolbar or by
                                        pressing <code>Ctrl + F5</code>. Or you can use either of the Start options in

                                        Enter two integer numbers when prompted. The program will multiply them and
                                        display
                                        the
                                        result. Observe that the output result is formatted with the numbers you entered
                                        and
                                        that the displayed result is the expected product of the two numbers.

                                        Use Visual Studio to create another console application project. This

                                        will ask the user to enter a distance in kilometers and then convert it to
                                        miles.

                                        This time, right-click the solution name (Lab01) in the Solution Explorer and
                                        choose
                                        <strong>Add &gt; New Project</strong>.

                                        Name it <code>kmToMiles</code>. It is important to use meaningful descriptive

                                        because it gives no indication of what the project is about. This will create a

                                        <strong>Note:</strong> The formula for converting kilometers to miles is:<br>
                                        <code>miles = kilometers * MILES_PER_KM</code>

                                        <strong>Note:</strong> The constant <code>MILES_PER_KM</code> is a constant
                                        variable that holds the value of 0.62. It is a good practice to use constants
                                        for values that do not change in your program.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It is also common practice to use all uppercase letters for constant
                                        identifiers (names).

                                        In the last exercise, you created integer variables to hold the values of the
                                        user inputs and the result. In this exercise, use double variables to store
                                        inputs,
                                        outputs and constants.
                                    </p>

                                        To convert a string to a double, use the <code>Convert.ToDouble()</code> method.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Give consideration to the names of your variables. Use descriptive names that
                                        indicate what the variable is used for. For example, <code>km</code> is a good
                                        name
                                        for a variable that holds the value of kilometers.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Avoid using <em>magic numbers</em> (unnamed constant values) in your code. For
                                        example, instead of using <code>0.62</code> in your code, use a constant
                                        variable
                                        with a meaningful name, such as <code>MILES_PER_KM</code>. This makes your code
                                        easier to read and understand. It also makes it easier to change the value of
                                        the
                                        constant in the future if needed.

                                        We emphasized the imprtance of using meaningful names for your projects,
                                        variables, and
                                        constants. We also emphasized the importance of using constants for values that
                                        do
                                        not change in your program.

                                        Finally, we stressed the need to test your code with a variety of inputs to
                                        confirm the
                                        correct results. This is a critical skill in software development. You will be
                                        expected to test your code with a variety of inputs in all future labs and
