                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            Chapter 8 looks at the fundamental concepts of value and reference types in C# 
                            and why they matter.                             
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Understanding the difference between value types and referency types is important
                            for effective memory management and application performance, but more importantly,
                            understanding how the program handles and stores its data is important to being 
                            able to select the right data types for each situation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you consider library book storage, the books themselves are stored on shelves
                            in rows and rooms. But they are indexed in a catalog that tells you where to find
                            each book. The catalog is a reference to the book, while the book itself is a value.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rather than searching through every book on the shelf, you can look up the
                            catalog to find the location of the book you want. This is similar to how value
                            and reference types work in C#. Value types store the actual data. Data such as 
                            integers, and doubles and booleans are examples of this. This data is stored on 
                            what is called the <em>stack</em>. It is fast to access and manipulate, but it 
                            is limited in size. Larger data elements, and data objects that might need to be
                            more persistent across different parts of the program, are stored in what is called
                            the <em>heap</em>. The heap is a larger area of memory that can store more complex
                            data structures, such as classes and arrays. However, accessing data in the heap is
                            slower than accessing data in the stack, because it requires a reference to the
                            data's location in memory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It takes longer to go to the library shelf and find the book, but it contains more
                            information than the index card in the catalog.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The textbook has very good examples and explanations of value and reference types.
                            I also recommend learning a little more about the stack and heap memory
                            management in C#. This is a fundamental concept that will help you understand
                            memory management in C# and other programming languages.
                        </p>

                            Here is a short video that helps explain the differences between memory storage.

                            A lot of the concepts and content in this chapter will help to explain the content
                            in the next. Take your time to read through the chapter and consider the examples.
