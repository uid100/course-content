                        <h3>Properties</h3>
                            <p>
                                Properties are a key feature of C# that provide a flexible mechanism to read, write, 
                                or compute the values of private fields. They enable data encapsulation and can 
                                include logic in their accessors.
                            </p>
                        <h4 style="font-style: italic;">Did we skip some chapters?</h4>
                        <p>
                            As a matter of fact, yes. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All textbook authors divide the content into smaller digestible pieces and 
                            sequence them in a way that makes sense and follows a logical progression. 
                            This textbook contains a lot of really good content that we will not have 
                            time to cover in this course.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The objectives of the course are to (first) provide you with a solid foundation 
                            in object-oriented programming, and (second) to introduce you to another popular 
                            programming language to practice those patterns and concepts. The additional 
                            content in the textbook is worthwhile, and you are encouraged to use this as a 
                            good reference for future use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As much as I do like and appreciate the author's approach and perspective, I 
                            believe that an understanding of how and why to use properties is too
                            important a concept to overlook, and I wish the author had prioritized it to
                            include it in earlier chapters. Properties are a fundamental part of C# and
                            are widely used in OOP (and C#) programming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In our introduction to classes and objects, we said that classes describe 
                            entities with attibutes (fields) and behaviors (methods). Properties really
                            fall into a category in between those two and share a lot of the same
                            characteristics as both fields and methods. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Like the author, my approach is to introduce you to the language and
                            the concepts in a way that builds on your existing knowledge and to emphasize
                            what I believe are the most important concepts to learn first.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the calendar runs out and we approach the end of the time available for 
                            this course, I believe that properties are too important to overlook.

                                The <strong>Visual Studio</strong> editor provides a lot of features that you
                                may not have discovered yet. One of these is the ability to generate properties
                                automatically based on field definitions. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you have a field defined in your class, you can right-click on the field name
                                and select <strong>Quick Actions and Refactorings</strong> (or press <code>Ctrl + .</code>).
                                From the menu that appears, select <strong>Encapsulate Field</strong>. This will generate
                                a property for that field with get and set accessors.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To create a new property, you can also type the <code>prop</code> snippet in the editor and 
                                press <code>Tab</code> twice. This will generate a property with a backing field and the get 
                                and set accessors.
                            </p>

                            On a related topic, the author refers to <em>getters</em> and <em>setters</em> as get and set 
                            accessors. This is a more formal term that is used, but most developers will refer to them
                            as simply getters and setters. Some authors will also refer to them as <em>accessors</em> 
                            and <em>mutators</em>, but this is less common. For common usage, if you use the terms
                            <em>getters</em> and <em>setters</em>, you will be understood by most developers.
