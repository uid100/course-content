                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            In chapter 6 we discuss the fundamental concepts of exception handling in C#. 
                            Exception handling is a crucial aspect of programming that allows developers to 
                            manage errors and unexpected situations gracefully, ensuring that applications 
                            can continue to run or fail safely without crashing.
                        </p>
                        <h3 style="font-style: italic;">What is an exception?</h3>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
                            An exception is an <em>unexpected</em> event that occurs during the execution.
                            Anything outside of the normal flow of the program is considered an exception.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trying to access a file that does not exist, is not necessarily an error,
                            but it is an exception. The program can handle this situation gracefully by
                            informing the user that the file is not found, rather than crashing or producing
                            an unhandled error.
                        </p>

            <div class="card"> <!-- .card try -->

                        The Try Block
                    </button>
                </div> <!-- .card-header -->
                <div id="try" class="collapse show">
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>
                            The try block is used to wrap code that might throw an exception. 
                            If an exception occurs within the try block, the program will jump to the catch block.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The try block is a way to tell the program to "try" to execute the code, and if an exception occurs,
                            it will be handled in the catch block.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Consider</h3>
                        <p>
                            Imagine walking into a classroom that you have never been in before. The lights are 
                            off, and there are 3 switched on the wall next to the door. You have no idea which
                            switch controls the lights, or if any of them do.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you flip a switch, there is no guarantee that the lights will turn on, or if something
                            else will occur. There is some risk involved in flipping the switch, but it is a very low
                            risk.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is an expectation that the switch will turn on the lights, but it is not guaranteed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is what a <code>try</code> block is like. You are trying to execute some code. You
                            have an expectation that the code will run without any issues, but there is a possibility
                            that an exception will occur.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Just like flipping the wall switch, you <strong>try</strong> the action, and wait to see
                            if you get the expected result. If not, you handle the situation. In the case of the 
                            lights, you might try another switch. In the case of the code, you handle the <em>likely</em> 
                            possibilities. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are dividing two numbers, you may expect a rational number as a result, but if 
                            the denominator is zero, you will get an exception. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So the first step is to <strong>try</strong> something with an expectation that it will
                            work, but if not, you anticipate what could go wrong, starting with the most likely
                            outcomes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This systematic <em>handling</em> of exceptions, from the most likely to the least likely,
                            is the essence of exception handling.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you have ever called a technical support line, you have probably been asked to
                            very rudimentary questions, starting at the very basic level while trying to resolve
                            an issue. The support technician is usually working through a checklist of common issues.
                            This is usually known as level-1 support.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the issue is not resolved at this level, the support technician may escalate the issue
                            to a more experienced technician, who will then work through a more advanced checklist of
                            common issues. This is usually known as level-2 support.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This continues until the issue is resolved, or it is determined that the issue cannot be 
                            resolved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the issue is not resolved, the customer may lose patience, become frustrated,
                            and give up and hang up the phone, unhappy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is similar to how exception handling works in programming. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When an exception occurs, the program will first try to handle it using logic 
                            built into that section of the code. If that logic cannot handle the exception,
                            the program will look for a higher-level handler, in the code which called the
                            current code. If it still cannot find a handler, it will continue to look in
                            the higher-level code until it finds a handler that can handle the exception,
                            or until it reaches the top level of the program, and if left unhandled,
                            the program will crash, just like the customer hanging up the phone.

                        <h3>Most likely, first</h3>
                        <p>
                            The catch block is used to handle exceptions that occur within the try block. 
                            If an exception occurs, the program will jump to the (local) catch block and 
                            execute the code within it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The catch block is a way to tell the program what to do if an exception occurs. 
                            It is like a safety net that catches the exception and allows the program to 
                            continue running.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There may be multiple catch blocks, each handling different types of exceptions.
                            When you <code>try</code> a block of code which has some risk of an exception,
                            you can anticipate the most likely exceptions that may occur, and handle them
                            in the catch block.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Generic exception handler</h3>
                        <p>
                            You have written code that you expect to run without any issues, but there are
                            some things that may happen. You start by identifying the most likely and 
                            <em>handle</em> those first.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But after you have presented handlers for the most likely exceptions,
                            and you still have not handled the exception, you can use a generic
                            exception handler to catch any other exceptions that may occur.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is like having a catch-all for any exceptions that you did not anticipate.
                            It is a way to ensure that your program does not crash, even if an unexpected
                            exception occurs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The generic exception handler should be the last catch block
                            in the sequence of catch blocks. It is a way to ensure that any
                            unhandled exceptions are caught and handled gracefully.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is a way of saying, "Well, something went wrong, and we tried everything
                            we could think of, but we don't want the program to crash, so we will
                            just acknowledge the error and continue running."

                            The finally block is used to execute code that should always run, regardless 
                            of whether an exception occurred or not. It is like a cleanup crew that comes 
                            in after the show is over, to make sure everything is in order.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The finally block is a way to ensure that certain code is always executed, even 
                            if an exception occurs. It is like a safety net that catches the exception and 
                            allows the program to continue running.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A common use case for the finally block is to close resources, such as files or
                            database connections, that were opened in the try block.

                            In addition to the built-in exceptions provided by C#, you can also create 
                            your own custom exceptions. This is useful when you want to handle specific 
                            errors that are not covered by the built-in exceptions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Custom exceptions can be created by inheriting from the <code>Exception</code> 
                            class and adding any additional properties or methods that you need.
