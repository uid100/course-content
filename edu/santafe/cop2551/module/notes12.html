                            I read recently that the most developers will use at least 14 different programming
                            languages in their careers. This is a pretty reasonable estimate. As you are exposed
                            to more languages, you will see that most share more similarities than differences, 
                            and that the design patterns and concepts are often the same. To this point you have
                            likely studied several languages already and will probably continue to do so. At some
                            point, you will likely be assigned to a longer term project that will build your 
                            expertise and confidence in a specific language. Don't 
                        </p>
