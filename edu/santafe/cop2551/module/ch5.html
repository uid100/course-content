                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            In this chapter we will explore compound assignment operators and iteration statements in C#.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Compound assignment operators allow you to perform an operation and assign the result to a
                            variable in a single step. For example, the <code>+=</code> operator adds a value to a variable
                            and assigns the result back to that variable, like this:
                            <code><pre>
x += 5; // equivalent to x = x + 5;
                            </pre></code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Iteration statements, also known as loops, allow you to execute a block of code multiple times
                            based on a condition.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Compound Assignment Operators</h2>
                        <p>
                            Compound assignment operators in C# allow you to perform an operation on a variable and
                            assign the result back to that variable in a single step. This can make your code more concise
                            and easier to read.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These will likely be familiar to you, as they are used in most popular programming languages.
                            The most common compound assignment operators in C# are:
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>+=</code> - Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result back to that variable.</li>
                                <li><code>-=</code> - Subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result back to that variable.</li>
                                <li><code>*=</code> - Multiplies a variable by a value and assigns the result back to that variable.</li>
                                <li><code>/=</code> - Divides a variable by a value and assigns the result back to that variable.</li>
                                <li><code>%=</code> - Calculates the modulus of a variable with respect to a value and assigns the result back to that variable.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            C# also supports compound assignment operators for bitwise operations. These operators allow the programmer
                            to modify the data at the bit level, which can be useful for low-level programming tasks and logic. For now,
                            we will stick with the arithmetic operators listed above.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If these operators are new to you, pay close attention to the syntax and how they work. Since they are 
                            all similar, once you understand one, the others will be easy to grasp. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you don't fully grasp their meaning right away, don't worry, but stick with it. These are <em>shorthand</em> 
                            expressions that are in very common use in programming, and you will see them often.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As you become used to seeing them, you will find that they make your code cleaner and easier to read.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>One thing to notice</strong> as you read through the chapter is that the variable's type dictates
                            the rules of the operation. The same operator that is used to add integers together, also works for combining
                            strings.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Incrementing and Decrementing</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is a good time to go back to chapter 2 and review the increment and decrement operators.
                            Not only are these also considered compound assignment operators, but they are also in very
                            common use in programming. As pre-fix and post-fix operators, you will see them often, and you
                            need to be comfortable with their use.
