                        <p>
                            In this chapter we will explore compound assignment operators and iteration statements in C#.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Compound assignment operators allow you to perform an operation and assign the result to a
                            variable in a single step. For example, the <code>+=</code> operator adds a value to a variable
                            and assigns the result back to that variable, like this:
                            <code><pre>
    x += 5; // equivalent to x = x + 5;</pre></code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Iteration statements, also known as loops, allow you to execute a block of code multiple times
                            based on a condition.

                        <h2>Compound Assignment Operators</h2>
                        <p>
                            Compound assignment operators in C# allow you to perform an operation on a variable and
                            assign the result back to that variable in a single step. This can make your code more concise
                            and easier to read.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These will likely be familiar to you, as they are used in most popular programming languages.
                            The most common compound assignment operators in C# are:
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>+=</code> Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result back to that variable.</li>
                                <li><code>-=</code> Subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result back to that variable.</li>
                                <li><code>*=</code> Multiplies a variable by a value and assigns the result back to that variable.</li>
                                <li><code>/=</code> Divides a variable by a value and assigns the result back to that variable.</li>
                                <li><code>%=</code> Calculates the modulus of a variable with respect to a value and assigns the result back to that variable.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            C# also supports compound assignment operators for bitwise operations. These operators allow the programmer
                            to modify the data at the bit level, which can be useful for low-level programming tasks and logic. For now,
                            we will stick with the arithmetic operators listed above.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If these operators are new to you, pay close attention to the syntax and how they work. Since they are 
                            all similar, once you understand one, the others will be easy to grasp. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you don't fully grasp their meaning right away, don't worry, but stick with it. These are <em>shorthand</em> 
                            expressions that are in very common use in programming, and you will see them often.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As you become used to seeing them, you will find that they make your code cleaner and easier to read.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>One thing to notice</strong> as you read through the chapter is that the variable's type dictates
                            the rules of the operation. The same operator that is used to add integers together, also works for combining
                            strings.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Incrementing and Decrementing</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is a good time to go back to chapter 2 and review the increment and decrement operators.
                            Not only are these also considered compound assignment operators, but they are also in very
                            common use in programming. As pre-fix and post-fix operators, you will see them often, and you
                            need to be comfortable with their use.

                        <h2>Iteration</h2>
                        <p>
                            To review, we began this programming discussion with the simple concept of sequential
                            processing. The idea of doing one thing after another. That was deliberately step one.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In step two, we introduced the idea of branching, or making decisions in our code.
                            This allowed us to create more complex programs that could react to different conditions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, in step three, we will introduce the concept of iteration, or repeating a block of code
                            multiple times. This is a powerful tool that allows us to process collections of data, perform
                            repetitive tasks, and create more dynamic and flexible programs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In C#, iteration statements, also known as loops, allow you to execute a block of code multiple
                            times based on a condition. This is useful for tasks that require repetition, such as processing
                            items in a collection or performing calculations until a certain condition is met.
                        </p>
                        <h3>WHILE, FOR, DO-WHILE</h3>
                        <p>
                            Imagine that there are 1000 people waiting to buy concert tickets, but there are only 700 seats 
                            available. The logic could be handled as a FOR loop through each of the tickets that are available 
                            to sell. When the number sold equals the number available, the loop exits and the "sold out" sign 
                            goes in the window. In this case, the number of tickets sold needs to be tracked with a counter, 
                            also called an "iterator" that would start at 0 (tickets sold) and count up until the number is 
                            at the end condition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course this could also be handled with a WHILE loop and instead of tracking number 
                            of tickets sold, keep an eye on the number left available instead, and when that number 
                            gets to zero (0), there are no more left to sell.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From this example you can see that FOR loops and WHILE loops can are almost always 
                            interchangeable. Which one you choose is sometimes a point of style, but usually 
                            depends on which reads most with the clearest logic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If I know how many times I need to execute the loop and the number is the important 
                            part of the control ( 10-pushups, 20-situps, 10-jumping jacks), then a FOR loop is 
                            more appropriate, if the end condition is more important than the number of times 
                            through the loop, then a WHILE loop makes more sense. Read each line of a file 
                            WHILE there are still lines to read and an end condition is met. In this case, I do 
                            not need to know how many lines there are, I just need to keep going, until I am done. 
                            I could use a FOR loop, but a WHILE loop is more logical.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-style: italic;">
                            Read that last paragraph again, and think about it.
                        </p>
                            The Do-While loop is a special case of the While loop. The important distinction is 
                            when the boolean end condition is evaluated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Do-While loop will always execute at least once, because the condition is evaluated 
                            after the first execution of the loop. This is useful when you want to ensure that the code 
                            inside the loop runs at least once, regardless of the condition.
                            </p>
                        <p style="font-style: italic;">
                            If the FOR and WHILE loops are interchangeable, then why do they both exist?<br>
                            The answer is primarily for readability and clarity of logic.
                        </p>
                        <h3>FOR EACH</h3>
                        <p>
                            C# has another (fourth) type of loop structure, the FOREACH loop.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This one is very useful to handle elements of a collection, but it works a little 
                            differently than the three from this chapter. Rather than stepping through each 
                            element, it uses a copy of each element.
                        <p>
                            This is a very important distinction. For now, we will just mention it and wait 
                            until later to discuss it in more detail in the context of data collections.
