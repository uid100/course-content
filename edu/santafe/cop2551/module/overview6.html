                        <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
                        <p>
                            This course intentionally focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts,
                            and <em>happens</em> to use .NET/C# platform as a demonstration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yes, the programming courses in the department are designed to not only teach you
                            programming, but also to provide experience with different programming tools and
                            languages. This is a C# course, but more than that, it is a course focused on 
                            <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong>, which is applicable across many 
                            programming languages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a programming career, you will likely use many different languages, tools and skills.
                            The goal of this course is to provide you with a solid foundation in OOP principles,
                            which you can apply in any programming language, including but not limited to C#.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Up to this point, we have reviewed basic programming constructs such as variables,
                            control structures, and data types. And along the way, we have investigated and 
                            practiced application of language-specific syntax. In this chapter, we introduce 
                            the concept of classes and objects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A class is a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of that class.
                            Classes encapsulate data for the object and methods to manipulate that data.
                            This chapter will cover how to define classes, instantiate objects, and manage 
                            access levels of class members.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Constructors</h3>
                        <p>
                            I do like the author's approach throughout most of the textbook. But there is
                            one point in this chapter that I would like to look at from another perspective.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Regarding "constructors," the textbook states that constructors are special methods
                            used to instantiate objects. This is important.
                        </p>
                        <p><blockquote>
                            "...It has the same name as the class, it can take parameters, but it cannot
                            return a value."
                        </blockquote></p>
                        <p>
                            This is not entirely accurate. It is a special method. It is called a <em>constructor</em>
                            because it is used to <strong>construct</strong> an object. If it <em>constructs</em>
                            something, then it must return something, right?
                            The textbook is correct in that it does not return a value in the same way that
                            a method returns a value. However, it does return an instance of the class, the 
                            object itself!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So no, the constructor will not define a return type in the source code, but take it for 
                            granted that it returns an instance of the class. This is a fundamental concept in OOP.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is much to explore in this module, but don't rush through it.
                            Take your time to understand the concepts of classes and objects, as they are
                            foundational to object-oriented programming.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Midterm</h3>
                        <p>
                            In addition to my chapter notes, the module lab exercise, and the chapter quiz,
                            there is a midterm exam that covers all the material from Chapters 1 through 7.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The midterm format will be very similar to the chapter quizzes and not surprisingly,
                            reuses much of the same content. I adjusted the schedule to allow an extra day for
                            you to complete the midterm exam, so that it isn't due on the same day as the
                            chapter quiz and lab exercise. 
                        </p>
