    <dt><em>Plagiarism</em></dt>
    <dd>Plagiarism hurts your personal &amp; professional reputation, the personal &amp; professional reputation of
        others, and the reputation of the college. Unless specified otherwise, all assignments in this class are to be
        completed and turned in on an individual basis. Even in the software industry, where most projects are done in a
        team environment, team members are expected to contribute substantial original effort to their assigned
        portion(s) of a project. Information technology professionals are expected to work to a high professional and
        ethical standard.</dd>
    <dd>The bottom line: You will not gain any benefit from this course if someone else is doing all the work and
        thinking for you. Plagiarism will not help get you ahead in future classes that build upon this one nor will it
        help you get ahead in the workplace!</dd>
    <dd>You are encouraged to share ideas and help each other but outright copying another's work (source code,
        documentation, etc.) will result in a zero score for all parties involved. Repeated offenses may result in
        referral for disciplinary action pursuant to the College guidelines for discipline in plagiarism matters. If you
        use the campus lab computers, make sure you take your personal storage media with you when you leave and don't
        leave hard copy source code/documentation lying around the lab or store your files in publicly accessible
        network folders.</dd>

    <dt>Attendance.</dt>
    <dd><em>Per district policy:</em><br />
        <blockquote>
            When absences exceed twice the number of hours that a class meets in one week for full
            semester-length classes, the instructor may institute an excessive absence drop. For
            short-term classes, the number of acceptable absences is proportionately shorter.<br />
            Failure to attend the first class meeting may result in the student being dropped from
            the class.<br />It is the student&rsquo;s responsibility to officially withdraw from any
            classes not attended and to discuss anticipated absences with the instructor.

    <dd>If you have missing assignments and/or Canvas metrics indicate no- or low participation
        with the course materials, You may be dropped from the class for <i>excessive absences</i>.
    </dd>
    <dd>I will make an effort to contact you through email before taking such action.</dd>
    <dd>Keep up with your assignments, and this won't be an issue.</dd>
    <dt>Bottom Line</dt>
    <dd>
        Complete all work on time.
    </dd>
    <dd>
        All work must be submitted to Canvas according to the assignment instructions. The instructor cannot submit
        "Attachments" to comments on behalf of students, and they are not queued for grading.
    </dd>
    <dd>
        Turn in all Projects on the due date by the time and method indicated in the instructions. Meeting due dates
        and
        deadlines is a sign of professionalism and is expected of all students and employees.
    </dd>
    <dd>
        The schedule for all of the required work - discussions, projects, and exams - is clearly posted in Canvas
        and any
        changes made to it will be shared in advance. Life events and computer access interruptions happen. Plan for
        what
        you can, and start assignments early, to anticipate and mitigate what you can't control.
    </dd>
    <dd>
        Simple terms, complete all work on time. Exceptions happen. read more in the
