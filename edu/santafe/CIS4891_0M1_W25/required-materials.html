    <dt>None. <em>(What?)</em></dt>
    <dd>A national initiative (<em>Zero Textbook Costs (ZTC)</em>), and one of the secondary goals for this course,
        is to reduce the financial burden of educational materials which may serve as a barrier to student access
        to education.</dd>
    <dd>In addition, the necessary life cycle activity of bringing reference materials from concept to print,
        especially for emerging technologies may interfere with the objective of accessing up-to-date information.</dd>
    <dd>Readings will be assigned from available online materials, supplemented by video and lab content, as well
        as internet search activities.</dd>
