    <dd>A national initiative (<em>Zero Textbook Costs (ZTC)</em>), and one of the secondary goals for this course,
        is to reduce the financial burden of educational materials which may serve as a barrier to student access
        to education.</dd>
    <dd>In addition, the necessary life cycle activity of bringing reference materials from concept to print,
        especially for emerging technologies may interfere with the objective of accessing up-to-date information.</dd>
    <dd>Readings will be assigned from available online materials, supplemented by video and lab content, as well
        as internet search activities.</dd>

    <dd>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li>✓ Access to a reliable computer with high speed internet access, microphone, and web camera.<br>
                <em> if you do not have high speed internet access you can use computers in any on campus lab to
                    complete your online coursework. </em>
            </li>
            <li>✓ Online exercises will be possible through available internet resources.</li>
            <li>✓ Other software and lab resources are available as downloadable content.</li>
            <li>✓ We recommend a USB headset with microphone (especially for online classes).</li>
            <li>✓ Video camera. The video camera on a cell phone or laptop will be sufficient for this course.</li>

            To complete the real-world exercises and demonstrations in this course, you will need to interact with live
            cloud services. This requires registering for accounts on cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google
            Cloud. These accounts are essential for accessing the tools and resources used in the course.
        </p>
        <p>
            A valid credit card will be required during the registration process to verify your identity and create the
            account. While this step is necessary, the cloud services we use offer free-tier options or credits that
            will cover the usage for this course. If the instructions are followed carefully, it is highly unlikely that
            you will incur any charges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Email accounts managed by the college are hosted within Azure Active Directory (AAD). These accounts are
            used for Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication for college resources. However, they may not be eligible for
            paid cloud services such as creating and running virtual machines or cloud storage accounts. The limitations
            on these accounts may prevent you from completing the exercises in this course.
        </p>
        <p>
            By registering for these accounts, you will gain valuable hands-on experience with cloud technologies. This
            practical knowledge will prepare you for real-world applications and strengthen your skills for future
            opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bottom line, students will need an active Azure account to use Azure services. And a student email address
            is not the same as an active service account.
