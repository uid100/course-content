    <dt>None. <em>(What?)</em></dt>
    <dd>A national initiative (<em>Zero Textbook Costs (ZTC)</em>), and one of my secondary goals for this course,
        is to reduce the financial burden of educational materials which may serve as a barrier to student access
        to education.</dd>
    <dd>In addition, the necessary life cycle activity of bringing reference materials from concept to print,
        especially for emerging technologies may interfere with the objective of accessing up-to-date information.</dd>
    <dd>Readings will be assigned from available online materials, supplemented by video and lab content, as well
        as internet search activities.</dd>
    <dt>Other Materials</dt>
    <dd>
        <dl>
            <dd>✓ Access to a reliable computer with high speed internet access, microphone, and web camera.</dd>
            <dd><em> if you do not have high speed internet access you can use computers in any on campus lab to
                    complete your online coursework. </em></dd>
            <dd>✓ Online exercises will be possible through available internet resources.</dd>
            <dd>✓ Other software and lab resources are available as downloadable content.</dd>
            <dd>✓ We recommend a USB headset with microphone (especially for online classes).</dd>
            <dd>✓ Video camera. The video camera on a cell phone or laptop will be sufficient for this course.</dd>

        To complete the real-world exercises and demonstrations in this course, you will need to interact with
        live cloud services. This requires registering for accounts on cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and
        Google Cloud. These accounts are essential for accessing the tools and resources used in the course.
    </dt>
    <dt>
        A valid credit card will be required during the registration process to verify your identity and create the
        account.
        While this step is necessary, the cloud services we use offer free-tier options or credits that will cover the
        usage
        for this course. If the instructions are followed carefully, it is highly unlikely that you will incur any
        charges.

        Email accounts managed by the college are hosted within Azure Active Directory (AAD). These accounts are used
        for
        Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication for college resources. However, they may not be eligible for paid cloud
        services
        such as creating and running virtual machines or cloud storage accounts. The limitations on these accounts may
        prevent
        you from completing the exercises in this course.
    </dt>
    <dt>
        By registering for these accounts, you will gain valuable hands-on experience with cloud technologies. This
        practical
        knowledge will prepare you for real-world applications and strengthen your skills for future opportunities.

        Bottom line, students will need an active Azure account to use Azure services. And a student email address is
        not the same as an active service account.
