    "This course will focus on the design and analysis of data structures
    and the use of algorithms. Through the introduction of the most widely
    used data structures employed in solving commonly encountered problems,
    such as linked lists, binary trees, queues, and stacks, students will
    learn different ways to organize data for easy access and efficient
    manipulation. Algorithms to solve classic problems, such as searching,
    sorting, hashing, and graph algorithms will also be presented. This
    course assumes the student has a basic understanding of object-oriented
    programming in the C++ programming language."
