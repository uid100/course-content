            "This course will focus on the design and analysis of data structures and the use of algorithms. Through the introduction of the most widely used data structures employed in solving commonly encountered problems, such as linked lists, binary trees, queues, and stacks, students will learn different ways to organize data for easy access and efficient manipulation. Algorithms to solve classic problems, such as searching, sorting, hashing, and graph algorithms will also be presented. This course assumes the student has a basic understanding of object-oriented programming in the C++ programming language.",
