    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>Access to a reliable computer with high speed internet access, microphone, and web camera.
            <em>If you do not have high speed internet access you can use computers in any on campus lab to complete
                your online coursework.</em>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Microsoft Visual Studio</strong><br>
            In order to stay in compliance with all copyright laws, download Visual Studio from Microsoft's website.
        </li>
        <li>In COP 2535, you are going to be discussing and developing object-orienged solutions for classical data
            handling algorithms using the C++ programming language. You will use the textbook as well as other online
            resources.
            Microsoft provides a Community Edition of Visual Studio (2022) available for Windows 10 and 11.
            <ul>
                <li>The Visual Studio set-up program installs the most current version of .NET Core, as well as SQL
                    Server 2016 Express LocalDB. You must use the Visual Studio IDE as that is the program your
                    instructor will use to grade your homework submissions.</li>
                <li>Microsoft Visual Studio for Mac is supported only as a .NET language compatible environment, Visual
                    Studio Code (not the same product) does support C++, and may be an acceptable, but not recommended
                    solution.</li>
                <li>It is highly recommended that students use a Windows computer for this course. There are systems
                    available for use in the student lab.</li>
