        <h1>Exception Handling</h1>
        <p>
            Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program, disrupting the normal flow of
            instructions, such as errors or unexpected conditions. Exception handling is the process of responding to
            these exceptions by catching, managing, and resolving them to prevent program crashes or improper behavior.
        </p>

                            Java defines special types of errors called exceptions for a number of reasons:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                To separate error handling from program logic. Exceptions allow programmers to write
                                their code in a more modular and reusable way, by separating the code that detects and
                                handles errors from the code that performs the main logic of the program. This makes the
                                code easier to read, understand, and maintain.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To provide a robust and consistent way to handle errors. Exceptions provide a standard
                                way to handle errors, which makes Java code more predictable and reliable. This is
                                especially important in large and complex applications, where errors can occur in many
                                different places.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To propagate errors up the call stack. Exceptions can be propagated up the call stack,
                                which allows errors to be handled at the appropriate level. For example, if a method
                                throws an exception, the calling method can catch the exception and handle it
                                accordingly. This allows programmers to centralize error handling in certain parts of
                                the application, making it easier to manage and troubleshoot errors.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To provide information about errors. Exceptions contain information about the error,
                                such as the type of error, the stack trace, and any additional details. This information
                                can be used to log the error, display a meaningful error message to the user, or take
                                other corrective action.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Java defines two types of exceptions: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. Checked
                            exceptions are exceptions that must be explicitly handled by the programmer. Unchecked
                            exceptions are exceptions that do not need to be explicitly handled by the programmer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Checked exceptions are typically used to handle errors that are beyond the control of the
                            programmer, such as errors caused by the underlying operating system or hardware. Unchecked
                            exceptions are typically used to handle errors that are caused by programmer mistakes, such
                            as null pointer exceptions and array index out of bounds exceptions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Java provides a number of built-in exceptions that can be used to handle common types of
                            errors, such as arithmetic exceptions, null pointer exceptions, and file not found
                            exceptions. Programmers can also define their own custom exceptions to handle specific types
                            of errors that are not covered by the built-in exceptions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, exceptions are a powerful tool that can be used to improve the robustness,
                            reliability, and maintainability of Java code.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Here are some specific examples of how exceptions can be used in Java:
                        </p>
                        <ul></ul>
                        <li>
                            Handling errors caused by user input. If a user enters invalid input, the program can throw
                            an exception, which can then be handled to display a meaningful error message to the user
                            and allow them to try again.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Handling errors caused by file operations. If a program tries to open a file that does not
                            exist, the program can throw an exception, which can then be handled to notify the user of
                            the error and allow them to take corrective action.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Handling errors caused by network operations. If a program tries to connect to a network
                            server that is unavailable, the program can throw an exception, which can then be handled to
                            retry the connection or notify the user of the error.
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            By using exceptions to handle errors, Java programs can become more robust, reliable, and
                            user-friendly.
                        </p>
