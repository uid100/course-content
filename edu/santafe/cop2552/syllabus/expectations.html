    <dd>I will be using the Canvas Course Management system for class activities. In addition to participating in online
        discussions, taking exams online and submitting labs online, I may provide various learning resources such as
        PowerPoint slides for each chapter, lecture/chapter notes, videos and code samples as needed to help you get
        through the chapter material. You are welcome and encouraged to use these learning resources in addition to the
        text material. Please feel free to ask if there's a particular code sample or a demonstration video that you
        need that isn't already available. I'm here to help you succeed.</dd>
    <dd>I will periodically (usually weekly) post announcements to the Class Announcements page and/or send out e-mails
        to class members that may include things such as class announcements, assignment due dates, exam reminders, and
        answers to frequently asked questions. To ensure that you are "kept in the loop", please make sure your e-mail
        address in Canvas is an e-mail account you check on a regular basis.</dd>
    <dd>Lab exercises and projects are intended to help reinforce the various program design and coding concepts being
        taught in the class. I will try to make the assignments "within reason" such that they can be completed within
        the allotted time but this may vary depending on the material and your prior experience. Due dates for each lab
        are posted in Canvas with the lab a ssignment. Please check the due date carefully and recheck periodically as I
        may adjust due dates depending on the needs of the class.</dd>
    <dd>
        Participation means actively participating in the course environment, whether online or in-person. Submitting
        assignments on time, sharing in the Discussion Cafe, and responding to your instructor and peers are all part of
        active participation.
    </dd>
    <dd>
        You are expected to complete each assignment with diligence, thoroughness, professionalism, and respect for your
        peers. High quality work is expected.
    </dd>
    <dd>
        Due dates for all assignments are to be submitted by 11:59 p.m. on the date specified. Late assignments will be
        given a grade of zero.
    </dd>
    <dd>
        Academic Dishonesty Consequences: Will incur a zero (0) on the assignment (cannot be dropped) AND a letter grade
        reduction.

    <dt>Virtual Office Hours</dt>
    <dd>I am available to assist you with questions and problems with assignments as needed. If you have questions
        regarding chapter material or assignments, you can e-mail me questions. There are also discussion forums on
        Canvas where you can post questions. I am also available through Zoom for live discussions during regular office
        hours:
        <p><strong>Wednesday 2P-3P</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

            </a><br />... and other times by request/appointment.</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>My goal is to help you succeed but it is your responsibility to ask for help if you need it.</dd>
