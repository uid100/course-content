    <dt>Instructor</dt>
    <dd>I will reply to email within 24 hours (usually quicker) on business days. Weekends may take a little longer.
    </dd>
    <dd>Office hours are open discussion times. Bring your questions, or drop by and join the discussion.</dd>
    <dt>Discussion Board</dt>
    <dd>There is an open discussion board for engaging with other students. Ask questions. Posting short code 'snippets'
        to support questions is acceptable. Posting complete solutions as 'examples' is not.</dd>
    <dt>Discord</dt>
    <dd>In the past, I've tried the Canvas discussion board, #Slack, and others, but (CS) students have been most
        receptive to using Discord, so I've recently jumped on board.<br />There is a link to the channel(s) on the home
        page to join. It is optional. I won't monitor the channel(s) all the time, but I will drop by. Feel free to
        engage in conversations there and answer eachother's questions too.</dd>
    <dt>Tutoring</dt>
    <dd>Follow the links from the College's home page for tutoring resources. Student Resources &gt; Learning Commons
        &gt; Tutoring Services</dd>
    <dt>Canvas</dt>
    <dd>Be sure to log in to Canvas several times a week for any announcements or discussions.</dd>
