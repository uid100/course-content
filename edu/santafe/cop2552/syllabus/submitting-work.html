        <p><strong>Complete all work on time.</strong></p>
        <p>All work must be submitted to Canvas according to the assignment instructions. The instructor cannot submit
            "Attachments" to comments on behalf of students, and they are not queued for grading.</p>
        <p>Turn in all Projects on the due date by the time and method indicated in the instructions. Meeting due dates
            and
            deadlines is a sign of professionalism and is expected of all students and employees.</p>
        <p>The schedule for all of the required work - discussions, projects, and exams - is clearly posted in Canvas
            and
            any changes made to it will be shared in advance. Life events and computer access interruptions happen. Plan
            for
            what you can, and start assignments early, to anticipate and mitigate what you can't control.</p>
        <p>Simple terms, <strong>complete all work on time.</strong> Exceptions happen. See <a
                href="late-policy.html">late policy.</a></p>
