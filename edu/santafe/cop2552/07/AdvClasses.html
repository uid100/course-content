                Inheritance and polymorphism are two important concepts in Java programming that allow for code
                reusability, flexibility, and extensibility.

                            <p>Assignment Overview</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Inheritance</strong> allows a new class to inherit the properties and
                                    methods of an existing class. This can be used to avoid duplicating code and to
                                    create a hierarchical relationship between classes. For example, we could create a
                                    <code>Vehicle</code> class that has properties and methods for all vehicles, such as
                                    <code>getSpeed()</code> and <code>brake()</code>. We could then create more specific
                                    classes, such as <code>Car</code> and <code>Truck</code>, that inherit from
                                    <code>Vehicle</code> and add their own unique properties and methods.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Polymorphism</strong> allows us to have different objects that respond to
                                    the same message in different ways. This is achieved through method overriding,
                                    where a subclass can provide its own implementation for a method that is also
                                    defined in its parent class. For example, the <code>Vehicle</code> class might have
                                    a method called <code>move()</code>. The <code>Car</code> class could override this
                                    method to provide its own implementation that describes how a car moves. This allows
                                    us to write code that is more flexible and extensible, as we don't have to worry
                                    about the specific type of object that we are working with.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Inheritance and polymorphism are powerful tools that can be used to improve the quality
                                and maintainability of Java code. By using these concepts effectively, we can write code
                                that is more reusable, flexible, and extensible.
                            </p>

                                The goal of this assignment is to expand on your knowledge of writing classes in java by
                                incorporating inheritance. You will implement several java classes some of which are
                                connected via the is-a relationship and some via the has-a relationship. As always,
                                other content such as arrays may show up in this programming assignment. In this
                                challenge you are going to write code to help a bike shop.

                            This programming assignment is tested using JUnit testing so the Tester class will help
                            guide you in finding the relationships between the classes along with this programming
                            assignment spec. The project comes with a number of files which are a mix of classes,
                            subclasses, abstract classes, interfaces, and the tester class. There is a lot going on, so
                            take it one test method at a time
