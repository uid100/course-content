        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            One-dimensional arrays (or 1D arrays) are a fundamental data structure in Java programming. They are used to
            store a collection of elements of the same type in a contiguous memory location. This makes it efficient to
            access elements of the array, as they can be accessed using their index.
        </p>
        <p>
            1D arrays are used in a wide variety of Java applications. For example, they can be used to store the scores
            of students in a class, the names of employees in a company, or the coordinates of points on a graph.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the benefits of working with 1D arrays include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Efficient access to elements:</strong>
                As mentioned earlier, 1D arrays can be accessed efficiently using their index. This makes them ideal for
                storing and retrieving large amounts of data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Easy to implement:</strong>
                1D arrays are relatively easy to implement in Java. They can be declared and initialized using a simple
                syntax.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Flexible:</strong>
                1D arrays can be used to store a variety of data types, including primitives (such as int, float, and
                String) and objects.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Robust:</strong>
                1D arrays are a robust data structure. They are not prone to errors, such as null pointer exceptions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Arrays in Java work just like you have seen them in other programming languages. This exercise is meant to
            refresh your memory of arrays and to get you started with Java programming. You will likely discover the
            syntax is very familiar to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the benefits mentioned above, 1D arrays are also used to implement other data structures,
            such as stacks, queues, and linked lists. This makes them even more important for Java programmers to
            understand.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of this assignment is for you to set up Java and Eclipse on your computer. You will learn to get
            starter code from GitHub and practice running them in Eclipse. Finally, you will review a little bit of
            programing concepts such as iteration, methods and arrays.

        <p>
            Module 1 programming assignment is set up as a JUnit assignment consisting of the challenge class called
            <strong>M1Challenge.java</strong> and the test class called <strong>TestM1Challenge.java. </strong>This
            simplistic setup is all you need to get started for this programming assignment. You will be reminded of the
            use of these two files repeatedly throughout this document.
        </p>
        <h3>M1Challenge</h3>
        <p>
            This is where you will be implementing the code. In this assignment, you will be completing a couple of
            methods and writing some from scratch.</p>
        <h3>TestM1Challenge</h3>
        <p>
            This is a set of code that has been provided for you. The code is broken up into a series of test methods
            that you will uncomment as you implement them in <strong>M1Challenge.java</strong></p>

        <h2>Programming Tasks</h2>
        <h3>M1Challenge.java</h3>
        <p>
            Let's take a look at the add method together in<strong> M1Challenge.java </strong>as shown below. The first
            thing you will notice is the comment above the add method which provides <strong>Javadoc</strong> style
            information. Javadoc is a built-in documentation generator that you can use in Java. If you type (above the
            method) <strong>/**</strong> then press enter, it will autogenerate the stub for you. You can delete the
            entire comment stub above the add method if you want to try this now on your own! <i>Side note: Sometimes
                parameter names might slightly differ, but they will represent the same thing in your code
                setup.</i><br /><br />
        <pre>
   /**
    * Purpose: add two numbers
    * @param a one number
    * @param b another number
    * @return the sum of a and b
    */
   public static int add(int a, int b)
   {
       return a + b;
   }
</pre>

        <h3>TestM1Challenge.java</h3>
        <p>
            Now let's take a look at the corresponding test method under <strong>TestM1Challenge.java</strong> as shown
            below.
            The test method has two assertions that run and evaluates if the two expressions are equal otherwise an
            <strong>AssertionError</strong> is thrown. <br /><br />AssertEquals(4, add(2, 2)): This checks if the return
            of
            add(2, 2) is equal to 4.<br />AssertEquals(0, add(2, -2)): This checks if the return of add(2, -2) is equal
            to
            0.
        </p>
        <pre>
    @Test
    void testAdd()
    {
        // add(..., ...) adds two numbers
        // This checks that add(2, 2) returns 4.
        assertEquals(4, add(2, 2));
        // This checks that add(2, -2) returns 0.
        assertEquals(0, add(2, -2));
    }
</pre>
        <p>
            Your workflow to complete this first programming challenge will involve editing both files as explained in
            more detail below.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first method, add, has been done for you! Let's complete one of the methods together so you can get
            familiar with a potential workflow for completing a programming challenge. Your workflow will change halfway
            through this programming challenge because you will go from completing provided methods to writing the full
            methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the first half of the programming challenge:
        <ul>
            <li> Implement the method </li>
            <li> Uncomment and run the test method </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>multiply</h4>
        <p>
            The method multiply will return the product of the parameters a and b. You will find that there is a random
            -11111 return provided in the method which is incorrect. This is provided so that the compiler is happy and
            you are able to run the code without having to complete all of the methods yet. Finish the method and run
            the project.
            It will run the test class by default.
        </p>
        <pre>
            /**
             * Purpose: multiply two numbers
             * @param a one number 
             * @param b another number
             * @return the product of a and b
             */
             public static int multiply(int a, int b)
             {
                // TODO: change this to make the tests pass
                <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #000000;">return -11111; //Should be return a * b</span>
            }
        </pre>

        <h4>getFirst:</h4>
        <p>
            This method has a single parameter named array. Access and return the first element. You will see that the
            tester for this method is commented out in <strong>TestM1Challenge.java.</strong> Take the time now to
            uncomment it then run the code. You will notice some very simplistic test cases have been written for this
            method. Some small arrays have been created and initialized which are then utilized in the assertions.
        </p>
        <pre>
            /**
             * Purpose: return the first element in the given array
             * 
             * @param array to search
             * @return first element
             */
             public static int getFirst(int[] array)
             {
                // TODO: change this method to make the tests pass
                return -77777; <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #000000;">// should be array[0]</span>
            }
        </pre>

        <h4>getLast, getMiddle</h4>
        <p>
            The process to complete these next two methods are similar to getFirst. Complete the method as described in
            the comment. You are accessing a specific location in the array, but be sure not to hardcode a specific
            number. It should be calculated based on the length of the given array.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Workflow</h3>
        <p>
            The workflow for the 2nd half of the programming challenge:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Look at the test method in TestM1Challenge.java and figure out what the method is that you are going to
                implement.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement the method the method in M1Challenge.java
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>max:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Let's look at the provided test method together. You will see numerous assertions, a.k.a. multiple
                tests, for this method. Each test uses an array which is then passed to the max method. If you have not
                guessed already, this method will find the maximum element in the array and return that element (its
                value, not position). This method, however, has not been written in
                <strong>M1Challenge</strong>.<strong>java</strong> and thus will result in a compile error. You cannot
                call a method that does not exist!
                <pre>
                    @Test
                    void testMax()
                    {
                        int[] array1 = { 1 };
                        // This checks that max returns 1 (the only element)
                        assertEquals(1, max(array1));
                        
                        array1[0] = -2147483648;
                        assertEquals(-2147483648, max(array1));
                        
                        int[] array2 = { 1, 2, 2147483647 };
                        // This checks that max returns 2147483647, the largest element
                        assertEquals(2147483647, max(array2));
                        
                        int[] array3 = { -1, 2, -2147483648 };
                        // This checks that max returns 2, which is the largest element
                        assertEquals(2, max(array3));
                        
                        int[] array4 = { -42, -2, -3 };
                        // This checks that max returns -2, which is the largest element
                        assertEquals(-2, max(array4));
                        
                        int[] array5 = { 3, 1, 2 };
                        assertEquals(3, max(array5));
                        
                        int[] array6 = { 2, 1, 3 };
                        assertEquals(3, max(array6));
                        
                        int[] array7 = { 2, 3, 1 };
                        assertEquals(3, max(array7));
                    }
                </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                Based on how the method should work, let's write the method header together for this one. The template
                for writing a method has been provided for you at the bottom of M1Challenge.java. You can copy-paste
                this block of code and fill in the parts. For the code below, I replaced the question marks with what
                each part represents for a Java method in case you need some hints! Let's do it together now.

                <pre>
                    // Use this template for the other methods
                    /**
                     * Purpose:
                     * 
                     * @param array
                     * @return
                     */
                    //public static {return type} {method name}({parameter type}[] array)
                    //{
                    //	return ???;
                    //}
                </pre>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>{return type}:</h4>
        <p>
            The return type of a method is the type of method being returned when the method is done executing.
            For example, it might return double, int, or boolean. If a method does not return data, it is void.
            For this max method, since it returns an element from an int array we know that it is returning an
            int.
        </p>

        <h4>{method name}:</h4>
        <p>
            Methods should be lowercase. For this one, the tester method gives us a hint that we
            should name the method <strong>max</strong>.
        </p>

        <h4>{parameter type}:</h4>
        <p>
            This can be a primitive type like int, double, boolean or arrays, Strings, or custom class types.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
            For this max method problem, the final method header will be:
        <pre>
                    public static int max(int[] array){
                    }
                </pre>
        </p>
        <p>

            Once you have added this in M1Challenge.java, you should see the compile error not go away quite
            yet! That's because the method header expects the method to return a value and currently is is not.
            To silence the compiler while you are debugging and thinking about your logic, you can add some
            dummy return line similar to what was done with the first few methods. Add<strong> return
                -1</strong> inside the method to make the compiler happy for now.
        </p>
        <pre>
                    public static int max(int[] array){
                        return -1; //dummy return to make compiler happy while you think about the code!
                    }
                </pre>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            Searching through an array will require you to use an array to visit each element in the array known
            as a traversal. Below is a typical loop for array traversal.
        <pre>
                    for(int i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++){
                        
                    }
                </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's combine this with the fact that we are looking for the largest element in the array. First, we
            can assume that the first element is the largest. As you walk the array, starting at the second
            element, check if that element is larger and mark it as the largest. Alter the for loop so that it
            can skip the first element since we will define that as our current maximum value. Below is the
            complete body of the max method along with the comments. The comments shown will showcase the type
            of comments you should be writing to earn full points on programming assignments in this class.
        <pre>
                    //assume first element in the array is the largest
                    int largest = array[0];
                    
                    //traverse the array starting at the 2nd element
                    for(int<strong> i = 1</strong>; i &lt; array.length; i++){
                        
                        //check to see if any element is greater and update largest
                        if(array[i] &gt; largest){
                            largest = array[i];
                        }
                    }
                    //return the result
                    return largest;
                </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now repeat this process for the remaining methods shown in the
            <strong>TestM1Challenge.java.</strong>
        </p>
