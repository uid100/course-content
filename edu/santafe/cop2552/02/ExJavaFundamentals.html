        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            One-dimensional arrays (or 1D arrays) are a fundamental data structure in Java programming. They are used to
            store a collection of elements of the same type in a contiguous memory location. This makes it efficient to
            access elements of the array, as they can be accessed using their index.
        </p>
        <p>
            1D arrays are used in a wide variety of Java applications. For example, they can be used to store the scores
            of
            students in a class, the names of employees in a company, or the coordinates of points on a graph.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some of the benefits of working with 1D arrays in Java programming:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Efficient access to elements:</strong>
                As mentioned earlier, 1D arrays can be accessed efficiently using their index. This makes them ideal for
                storing and retrieving large amounts of data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Easy to implement:</strong>
                1D arrays are relatively easy to implement in Java. They can be declared and initialized using a simple
                syntax.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Flexible:</strong>
                1D arrays can be used to store a variety of data types, including primitives (such as int, float, and
                String) and objects.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Robust:</strong>
                1D arrays are a robust data structure. They are not prone to errors, such as null pointer exceptions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Overall, 1D arrays are a powerful and versatile data structure that can be used to solve a wide variety of
            problems in Java programming. If you are new to Java, I highly recommend learning about 1D arrays. They are
            a
            fundamental building block of Java programming and will be used in many of the applications that you will
            develop.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the benefits mentioned above, 1D arrays are also used to implement other data structures,
            such as stacks, queues, and linked lists. This makes them even more important for Java programmers to
            understand.

            The goal of this assignment is for you to set up Java and Eclipse on your computer. You will learn to get
            starter code from GitHub and practice running them in Eclipse. Finally, you will review a little bit of
            programing concepts such as iteration, methods and arrays.
        </p>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>
            Use the link: <a href="https://github.com/uid100/JavaFundamentals">
                https://github.com/uid100/JavaFundamentals</a> to get
            the starter code for this assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Download the code and open it in Eclipse.
        </p>
        <p>
            The test cases are provided in the src folder. You will need to uncomment each test case and provide the
            code for the logic to make the test pass.
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info" style="font-style: italic;">
            Don't forget to go back and refactor (clean up) your code after you get it working. This is a good habit to
            have.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you are finished, zip the project and submit to assignment page as you did in the previous module.
