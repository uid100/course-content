                                In this assignment you will implementing a simple fishing game that will have you
                                explore many of the most common widgets in the Java Swing library. You will also be
                                asked to consider coding the connection between the GUI and the code behind the scenes
                                using the model-view-controller software design pattern.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This assignment is a little different.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to ensuring the unit tests all pass, and be sure that all the User Stories
                                are implemented.
                            </p>

                                The tested portion of this programming assignment is very short. The majority of the
                                work will be on creating the GUI and implementing the stories where you will work
                                directly with the GUI rather than the tester file.

                                The user stories for this assignment are as follows:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    As a computer user, I can see a window with the title "Gone Fishing" so I can see
                                    what program I am running.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    As a computer user, when I click on the X in the top corner of the window, the
                                    program exits.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    As a computer user, I can see instructions in the window.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    As a computer user, I can see who programmed the game.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    As a computer user, I can see the grid where the game is played. The grid is 6 by 6
                                    buttons.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    As a computer user, when I start the program, I can see all the UI widgets in the
                                    game.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    As a player, I can see how many tries I have left on a slider, so I can see if I am
                                    winning. I start with 30 tries.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    As a player, I can see how many schools of fish are left on a slider, so I can see
                                    if the fish are winning. The game starts with 10 schools of fish.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    When I click on a button in the grid, it shows me if I caught a fish or not, so I
                                    can see my fishing skills.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    I click on a button in the grid, I cannot click on it again, so I cannot cheat.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    I click on a button, the number of tries goes down by one.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    When I click on a button, and I caught a school of fish, the number of schools of
                                    fish goes down by one.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If I manage to catch all the fish before I run out of tries, I get a message: "Game
                                    Over - You Win!" and the program exits.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If I run out of tries before I have caught all the fish, I get a message: "Game Over
                                    - Fishes Win!" and the program exits.
                                </li>
