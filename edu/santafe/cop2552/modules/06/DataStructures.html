        <h1>Data Structures and Generic Collections</h1>
        <p>
            Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be
            accessed and modified efficiently. They are fundamental to designing efficient
            algorithms and optimizing performance. Generic collections are a group of pre-built data
            structures in programming that allow storing and manipulating collections of objects in
            a type-safe manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            An in-depth study of data structures and generic collections will not only introduce and explain the
            structures and usage, but also provide guidance about which structure to use in different scenarios based on
            performance and efficiency requirements for a given situation or data set.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, we will introduce some common data structures and generic collections in Java, and provide some
            examples.
        </p>
        <p>
            These common data structures and collections offer various advantages depending on the specific
            use case, such as ease of access, insertion, or searching, and can be applied based on
            the requirements of a given algorithm or system design.

            <summary>ArrayList</summary>
            <p>
                An ArrayList is a resizable array-based collection. It allows dynamic resizing as
                elements are added or removed. Elements can be accessed via an index, making retrieval
                fast, but insertions or deletions in the middle of the list are slower compared to other
                structures.

            <summary>Queue</summary>
            <p>
                A Queue is a linear collection that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
                Elements are added to the back and removed from the front. Queues are commonly used for
                scheduling tasks or managing resources.

            <summary>Linked List</summary>
            <p>
                A Linked List is a collection of elements called nodes, where each node contains data
                and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. In a singly linked list,
                each node points to the next node, while in a doubly linked list, each node has
                references to both the previous and next nodes. It allows efficient insertion and
                deletion but has slower element access compared to arrays.

            <summary>Stack</summary>
            <p>
                A Stack is a collection that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. Elements
                are added and removed from the same end, called the "top" of the stack. Stacks are often
                used in algorithm implementations, like recursion, function call management, and
                expression evaluation.

            <summary>Hash Table</summary>
            <p>
                A Hash Table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to
                compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, where the desired value can be found.
                Hash tables provide fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, but the efficiency
                depends on the quality of the hash function.

            <summary>Binary Tree</summary>
            <p>
                A Binary Tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes. Each node has a value, and
                nodes can have child nodes. The most common form is a binary tree, where each node has at
                most two children. Binary Trees are used in databases, search algorithms, and hierarchical data
                representation.
