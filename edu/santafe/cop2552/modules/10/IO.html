        <h1>Input/Output (IO) in Java</h1>
        <p>
            Text I/O (Input/Output) in Java involves reading from and writing to text-based data sources like files,
            user input, or network streams using classes such as BufferedReader, PrintWriter, and FileReader. These
            classes facilitate efficient handling of character streams, enabling the processing of data line by line or
            character by character in a human-readable format.

                            The ability to read files is important in Java programming for a number of reasons:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Data persistence:</strong>
                                Files provide a way to store data persistently, meaning that it can be
                                accessed and used even after the program that created it has terminated. This is
                                essential
                                for many applications, such as databases, web servers, and file managers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Data exchange:</strong>
                                Files can also be used to exchange data between different programs and
                                devices. For example, a program might read data from a file created by another program,
                                or a
                                program might write data to a file that will be read by a device such as a printer or a
                                USB
                                drive.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Configuration:</strong>
                                Files can also be used to store configuration data for programs. This type of
                                data typically includes things like database connection strings, server addresses, and
                                user
                                preferences. Reading configuration data from a file allows programs to be more easily
                                configured and maintained.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            In addition to these general reasons, the ability to read files is also important for many
                            specific Java applications. For example, web servers use files to store web pages and other
                            static resources. Database applications use files to store database schema and data. And
                            file managers use files to store and organize files on a computer's hard drive.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Here are some specific examples of how the ability to read files is used in Java
                            programming:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                A web server might read a file containing a web page and send it to a user's web
                                browser.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A database application might read a file containing a database schema and create a new
                                database based on that schema.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A file manager might read a file containing a list of files and folders on a computer's
                                hard
                                drive and display that list to the user.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A text editor might read a file containing a text document and display the contents of
                                the
                                document to the user.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A compiler might read a file containing a Java source code file and compile it into a
                                Java
                                class file.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Overall, the ability to read files is an essential skill for any Java programmer. By being
                            able to read files, you can create programs that can interact with the outside world,
                            exchange data with other programs, and store and retrieve data persistently.
