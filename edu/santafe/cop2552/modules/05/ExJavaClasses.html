                                Java classes are the building blocks of Java programs. They are used to define the data
                                and behavior of objects. Classes are needed in Java because they provide a way to
                                encapsulate data and behavior, which makes programs more modular, reusable, and
                                maintainable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here are some of the specific reasons why Java classes are needed:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    To define the data and behavior of objects: A class defines the
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    To define the data and behavior of objects: A class defines the data that an object
                                    can
                                    hold, as well as the methods that an object can perform. This allows us to create
                                    objects that have specific properties and can perform specific actions.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    To improve modularity: Classes can be grouped into packages, which makes it easier
                                    to
                                    organize and manage code. This also makes it easier to reuse code, as we can simply
                                    import the classes that we need from a package.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    To improve reusability: Classes can be reused in multiple programs. This saves time
                                    and
                                    effort, as we don't have to rewrite the same code over and over again.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    To improve maintainability: Classes make it easier to maintain programs, as changes
                                    to a
                                    class can be made without affecting other parts of the program.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                In short, Java classes are essential for writing well-organized, reusable, and
                                maintainable Java programs.
                            </p>

                                <p>To uncomment blocks of code all at once in Eclipse, select the commented code and use
                                    shift+'/' or command+'/' on a Mac. This will uncomment the code. Use the same key
                                    combination to comment the code.</p>

                                The shop needs to be able to store data about their boats, such a make, color, speed and
                                price. Furthermore, the shop also needs to keep track of where their boats are stored.
                            </p>

                                As before, you will be given the test cases and you will need to write the code and add
                                the classes to make the tests pass.
