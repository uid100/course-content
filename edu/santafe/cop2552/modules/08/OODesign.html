            OOP is a programming style that emphasizes the use of objects, which are instances of classes, to represent
            data and methods that operate on that data.

                                Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is widely used in Java.
                                OOP is a programming style that emphasizes the use of objects, which are instances of
                                classes, to represent data and methods that operate on that data. OOP provides a clear
                                structure for programs, making them easier to maintain, modify, and debug. It also helps
                                to keep the code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) by reducing the repetition of code. OOP
                                makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter
                                development time. Java’s OOP features include classes, objects, inheritance,
                                encapsulation, and polymorphism.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Interfaces and abstract classes are important in Java OOP for several reasons. Both of
                                these concepts allow developers to create more flexible and modular code that can be
                                easily extended and reused. Interfaces are used to define a set of methods that a class
                                must implement. They provide a way to achieve abstraction in Java, which is one of the
                                key features of OOP. Interfaces are useful when you want to define a contract that must
                                be followed by any class that implements it. They also allow you to create code that is
                                more loosely coupled, which makes it easier to maintain and modify. For example, you can
                                define an interface for a database connection and then have multiple classes implement
                                that interface to connect to different types of databases.
                            </p>

                                Abstract classes are similar to interfaces, but they can also include implemented
                                methods. Abstract classes are used to provide a base class for concrete subclasses to
                                inherit from. They allow you to define a set of methods that must be implemented by any
                                subclass, while also providing some default behavior that can be inherited by those
                                subclasses. Abstract classes are useful when you want to create a class hierarchy that
                                shares some common functionality, but also has some unique behavior in each subclass.
                            </p>

                                By using interfaces and abstract classes, developers can create code that is more
                                scalable and easier to maintain over time.
