                            <p>Two-dimensional arrays (2D arrays) are a data structure that can be used to store
                                data in a tabular format. Each element in a 2D array is associated with a row and a
                                column number. This makes 2D arrays ideal for storing data that is naturally
                                organized in rows and columns, such as spreadsheets, matrices, images, and game
                                boards.</p>
                            <p>Working with 2D arrays in Java is relatively straightforward. The <code>int[][]</code>
                                data type is used to declare a 2D array. The first dimension of the array represents
                                the number of rows, and the second dimension represents the number of columns. Each
                                element in the array can be accessed using its row and column numbers.</p>
                            <p>2D arrays are a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems in
                                Java programming. They are especially useful for applications that involve data tables,
                                image processing, and game development.</p>
                            <p>Here are some specific examples of how 2D arrays are used in Java programming:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Data tables: 2D arrays can be used to store data in a tabular format, such as a
                                        spreadsheet or a database table. This makes them ideal for applications that
                                        need to store and manipulate large amounts of data.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Image processing: 2D arrays can be used to store the pixels of an image. This
                                        allows Java programs to manipulate images by accessing and modifying individual
                                        pixels.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Game development: 2D arrays can be used to store the game board, the player's
                                        position, and the position of enemies and other objects in the game. This allows
                                        Java games to be rendered and updated efficiently.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As mentioned, 2D arrays are a data structure that can be used to store data in a tabular
                                format. This makes them ideal for storing images, which are naturally organized in rows
                                and columns of pixels. A pixel is the smallest unit of an image. It is a tiny dot that
                                is assigned a color value. The color value of a pixel is typically represented by three
                                numbers, one for each of the primary colors: red, green, and blue (RGB).</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><img style="float: left;"
                                    src="https://uid100.github.io/course-content/images/pixelated_cat.png"
                                    alt="Cat image that is obviously pixelated" width="112" height="112" />
                                In a digital image, the pixels are arranged in a 2D grid. The number of rows and columns
                                in the grid determines the resolution of the image. The higher the resolution, the more
                                pixels there are in the image, and the more detail the image can show. The pixels in an
                                image can be stored in a 2D array. The first dimension of the array represents the rows
                                of pixels, and the second dimension represents the columns of pixels. Each element in
                                the array stores the color value of a single pixel. </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, a 100x100 image with 24-bit color depth (which means each pixel can have
                                256 possible colors) would be stored in a 2D array of size 100x100x24. The first
                                dimension of the array would represent the 100 rows of pixels, the second dimension
                                would represent the 100 columns of pixels, and the third dimension would represent the
                                24 bits of color information for each pixel.</p>
                            <p>
                                By storing images in 2D arrays, Java programs can access and manipulate individual
                                pixels quickly and efficiently. This makes it possible to perform a variety of image
                                processing tasks, such as resizing, cropping, rotating, and filtering images. You will
                                complete different "filters" that will be applied to digital pictures. These are common
                                filters that you may find in photo editing software like Photoshop and your favorite
                                mobile apps! Learn more about these in the Programming Tasks section.</p>

                                file, <strong>Logic.java</strong>. There are a lot of supporting class files for which
                                there is documentation if you get curious, but you are not required to go through them.
                                In short, this project setup allows you to work with images as two-dimensional arrays of
                                Pixel objects. You do, however, need to be able to work with a Pixel object so the
                                following is a summary of the class so you can work with the Pixels as if they are
                                numbers.</p>

                            <h2>TesterPictureLab.java:</h2>
                            <p>The main runnable for programming assignments. This is what you will be running to get
                                the program to launch. This is also where you can change the file you wish to load for
                                the program. No changes to this file should be required.</p>

                            <h2>PictureExplorer.java</h2>
                            <p>This is the class that handles a lot of the GUI-related functions of the JFrame you see
                                pop up! Once you complete your filter, if you want to be able to use the buttons, you
                                will go into this file and uncomment the appropriate line of code that will call your
                                filter on a button click event. </p>

                            <h2>Pixel.java</h2>
                            <p>A pixel is the smallest unit of a display, in this case, of a picture. A picture is made
                                up of hundreds, thousands, or millions of pixels to make up the entire image. For
                                example, a <i>4K</i> image with a dimension of 3840 x 2160 has 8,294,400 pixels. </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>A pixel has a color made up of the 3 colors red, green, and blue</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>These colors can be retrieved using their corresponding getters: getRed,
                                        getGreen, getBlue. An example is shown.<br />
                                    <pre>int greenValue = p.getGreen(); //assuming p is a Pixel object</pre>
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>These color values can also be set using their corresponding setters: setRed,
                                        setGreen, setBlue. For example:<br />
                                    <pre>p.setGreen(40);</pre>
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>The range of values for each color channel, red, green, and blue, is between 0
                                        and 255 inclusive.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>0 means no amount of color, and 255 is the maximum amount.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                    <li>Access each position in the two-dimensional array and use the setter for the
                                        color channel of interest. In this case, you are altering the blue color channel
                                        so you should use <strong>setBlue</strong>. The value to set them to should be 0
                                        to remove all the blue from the picture.</li>
                                    <li>Run the PictureTester.java file and click on the zeroBlue button to run your
                                        method on the picture. You should see a pretty major difference unless you have
                                        color blindness in a specific color channel. If that is the case, please try

                                    Pixel objects, but for this assignment, just swap <i><strong>colors</strong></i>
                                    between Pixel objects.</p>

                                    This is a more challenging filter as you must consider a rectangular window that
                                    will move throughout the image.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        Take a 2x2 window (starting from the upper-left corner of the image) and sum
                                        all the red, green, and blue values separately for all the pixels in that
                                        window. In a 2-by-2 window, there will be a total of 4 pixels for which to
                                        sum the three separate color channels.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Take the sum found for each channel of all the pixels in the window and
                                        divide them by 4. (4 pixels in the combined, <em>blurred</em> area.)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Set the red, green, and blue values of the top-left-most pixel of the
                                        2-by-2 window to be the value calculated from #2.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Perform this on the entire image moving the 2x2 window by one pixel each
                                        time from left-to-right and top-to-bottom where top-most will be row 0 and
                                        left-most is column 0.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
