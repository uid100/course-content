        <h1>Recursion in Java</h1>
        <p>
            Recursion in programming is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. This approach
            breaks down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable instances of the same problem. A recursive
            function generally has two parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Base Case</strong> - The condition under which the function stops calling itself, preventing an
                infinite loop.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Recursive Case</strong> - The function calls itself with modified arguments, progressively
                moving toward the base case.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Here's an example of a simple recursive function in Java that calculates the factorial of a number:
        </p>
        <pre><code>public class Factorial {
    public static int factorial(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1; // Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
        } else {
            return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
        }
    }
    </code></pre>
        <p>
            In this example, the <code>factorial</code> function calculates the factorial of a number <code>n</code> by
            recursively calling itself with <code>n-1</code> until it reaches the base case where <code>n</code> is 0.
            The base case returns 1, and the recursive case multiplies <code>n</code> by the factorial of
            <code>n-1</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recursion can be a powerful tool for solving problems that have a self-similar structure, such as tree
            traversal, divide-and-conquer algorithms, and mathematical calculations. However, it can also be less
            efficient than iterative solutions due to the overhead of function calls and memory usage.
        </p>
        <h2>When and Why Recursion is Used</h2>
        <p>
            Recursion is particularly useful for tasks that can naturally be divided into similar sub-tasks, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Tree Traversal</strong> - Navigating hierarchical data structures like trees or directories.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms</strong> - Algorithms like merge sort, where problems are split
                and solved recursively.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Problem Solving in Mathematical Domains</strong> - Calculations like factorials, Fibonacci
                sequences, or combinations.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Recursion simplifies code for problems that have self-similar structure, making it more readable and easier
            to implement than iterative solutions, although it can be less efficient due to added function call overhead
            and memory usage.

                    <p>
                        Be sure to have the latest version of the project from the repository before starting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Get the starter code from: <a href="https://github.com/uid100/JavaRecursion" target="_blank">
                            https://github.com/uid100/JavaRecursion</a>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Download the code and open it in Eclipse.
                        </li>
                        <li style="background-color: yellow; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">There are
                            more detailed instructions in the README.md file in the GitHub repository.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The test cases are provided in the src folder. You will need to uncomment each test
                            case and provide the code for the logic to make the test pass.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <span class="ic-flash-info" style="font-style: italic;">
                        Don't forget to go back and refactor (clean up) your code after you get it working. This
                        is a good habit to have.
                    </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            When you are finished, zip the project and submit to assignment page as you did in
                            the previous module.
                        </li>
