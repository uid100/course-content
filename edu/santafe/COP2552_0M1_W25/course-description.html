    "This course is a continuation of structured programming concepts using the Java programming language. This includes
    techniques for algorithm development, coding and testing. This course teaches advanced object-oriented programming
    concepts including classes and objects, exception handling, advanced file I/O, inheritance and polymorphism, JavaFX,
    and the use of databases within an application. Students will create event-driven applications to reinforce new
    concepts and material presented in each chapter."
