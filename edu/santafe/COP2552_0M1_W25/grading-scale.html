    Complete all work on time.

    All work must be submitted to Canvas according to the assignment instructions. The instructor cannot submit
    "Attachments" to comments on behalf of students, and they are not queued for grading.
</p>
<p>
    Turn in all Projects on the due date by the time and method indicated in the instructions. Meeting due dates and
    deadlines is a sign of professionalism and is expected of all students and employees.
</p>
<p>
    The schedule for all of the required work - discussions, projects, and exams - is clearly posted in Canvas and any
    changes made to it will be shared in advance. Life events and computer access interruptions happen. Plan for what
    you can, and start assignments early, to anticipate and mitigate what you can't control.
