    <dd>Consistency and time commitment is required and critical to success in this course.</dd>
    <dd>We will be using the Canvas course management system for class activities. In addition to participating in
        online
        discussions, taking exams online and submitting labs online, I may provide various learning resources such as
        PowerPoint slides for each chapter, lecture/chapter notes, videos and code samples as needed to help you get
        through the chapter material. You are welcome and encouraged to use these learning resources in addition to the
        text material. Please feel free to ask if there's a particular code sample or a demonstration video that you
        need that isn't already available. I'm here to help you succeed.</dd>
    <dd>Assignments must be submitted to Canvas when the assignment is availble. Do attach assignments
        to emails or Canvas comment fields. I will not accept assignments via email. If you have a problem submitting an
        assignment to Canvas, please contact me immediately.</dd>
    </dd>
    <dd>I will periodically (usually weekly) post announcements to the Class Announcements page and/or send out e-mails
        to class members that may include things such as class announcements, assignment due dates, exam reminders, and
        answers to frequently asked questions. To ensure that you are "kept in the loop", please make sure your e-mail
        address in Canvas is an e-mail account you check on a regular basis.</dd>
    <dd>Lab exercises and projects are intended to help reinforce the various program design and coding concepts being
        taught in the class. The assignments are intentionally scheduled such that they can be reasonably completed
        within
        the allotted time but this may vary depending on the material and your prior experience. Due dates for each lab
        are posted in Canvas with the lab a ssignment. Please check the due date carefully and recheck periodically as I
        may adjust due dates depending on the needs of the class.</dd>
    <dd>
        Participation means actively participating in the course environment, whether online or in-person. Submitting
        assignments on time, sharing in online discussions, and responding to your instructor and peers are all part of
        active participation.
    </dd>
    <dd>
        You are expected to complete each assignment with diligence, thoroughness, professionalism, and respect for your
        peers. High quality work is expected.
    </dd>
    <dd>
        Due dates for all assignments are to be submitted by 11:59 p.m. on the date specified. Late assignments will be
        given a grade of zero. Read more about the <a href="/course-content/common/late-polcy.html" target="_blank">late
            policy.</a>
    </dd>
    <dd>
        Academic Dishonesty Consequences: Will incur a zero (0) on the assignment (cannot be dropped) AND a letter grade
        reduction.

    <dd>I am available to assist you with questions and problems with assignments as needed. If you have questions
        regarding chapter material or assignments, you can e-mail me questions. There are also discussion forums on
        Canvas where you can post questions. I am also available through Zoom for live discussions during regular office
        hours as posted above and other times by request/appointment.</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>My goal is to help you succeed but it is your responsibility to ask for help if you need it.</dd>
