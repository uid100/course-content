            Some years ago, I shared my ramblings about the common reluctance to ask for help in the context of
            learning. I was reflecting on the fact that many students are hesitant to ask for help, even when they are
            struggling. I suggested that this reluctance is often rooted in a fear of appearing weak or incompetent. I
            also suggested that this fear is often unfounded, as most people are more than willing to help others when
            asked.

            In the course of teaching computer programming there are many opportunities for demonstrating code
            generation and development. One effective technique is to occasionally introduce errors into not only the
            code, but in the coding process. Whether intentional or not, there are many opportunities to question the
            code, the process, and the results. This is a great way to demonstrate the importance of asking questions
            and seeking help.
        </p>
        <p>
            More than just asking what the error is, or how to fix it. Students have shared with me they are encouraged
            by the observations that common errors happen to everyone, and learning where to find help and answers is as
            important as knowing the answers, and probably more valuable in a rapidly evolving technical field.

        <h2>Reflections on Change</h2>
        <p>
            Teaching in many colleges and universities and across timezones, states, and cultures, each semester I try
            to align as many related course materials as possible to maximize effectiveness and efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have found that the more I can standardize the course materials, the more time I have to focus on the
            students and their learning. Still, in addition to the continuos improvement efforts, I also seem to be
            writing new courses for at least one to two courses each semester, with little or no pre-existing course
            materials. This does present a limitation on the time I can spend on each course, but it also provides an
            opportunity to explore new ideas and new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting with the facilities shutdown of the pandemic, there was and increased search for ways to keep
            students connected and engaged - with the instructor, with the course materials, and with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            The shift in focus and reminder for reporting of Regular Student Interaction (RSI) metrics reiterated the
            limits on my own time and commitments. The shift from industry to part-time instructor, was a net cut in
            my income of about 80%. Still, I am much more likely to say 'no' to a new course or a new project, than I
            once was. I appreciate and value the time I can spend with students, but I'm increasingly resentful of the
            time I spend on administrative tasks and uncompensated work developing content not directly related to the
            course materials for reuse.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this course, I have adopted some adjustments, such as using a template for summarizing student
            <em>lessons learned</em> and <em>best practices</em> to be shared in weekly announcements. Also, I have
            reaffirmation of my adjusted assignment deadlines to Saturday (+24hr) instead of Sundays (+24hr) since it
            has given me so much more time to review and assignments and provide earlier and more quality feedback,
            which could not be completed when the assignments were not received until Tuesdays. More than significant
            changes and overhaul, I have made many small adjustments to my teaching and course materials to improve
            the student experience and my own.

            A common theme in most colleges where I teach is related to <em>ghost students</em>. There is an
            increasingly common practice of students enrolling in courses, but not participating in the course. This
            is a problem for the students, the instructors, and the colleges. There is significant financial incentive
            for enrolling in college courses, but there is no incentive for the students to participate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Staying enrolled in an online course beyond the census date usually requires very little effort, and
            students can often remain enrolled in a course without participating. After the census date, some colleges
            make it difficult for to drop a student from a course. These fictitious students take up valuable resources
            and time from the college and the instructor, and have a tangible fiscal impact on the college and the state
            as well as limiting access to the course for students who are interested in participating.
        </p>
        <p>
            The early advisory reporting is helpful to some point. At some schools, I have been able and encouraged to
            drop students who have not participated in online courses beyond the census date, but in others (this one)
            I have created detailed performance reports and spent time on communication attempts. In more than a few
            cases, this has involved academic advisors, department staff, only to be resolved that the student is
            responsible for withdrawing from the course, often while continuing to receive financial aid, with no
            incentive
            to withdraw, and will simply fail the course, and reenroll in the next semester.
        </p>
        <p>
            My question is what addition resources do we, as instructors, have to remove these ghost students from our
            courses? What are the best practices for dealing with ghost students?
