        <em>Internet Protocols</em>
    </p>

    <h4>Student Learning Objectives</h4>
    <p>
        &#10004;&nbsp; <strong>Describe</strong> TCP/IP Packet Transmission
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>
        Transmission Control Protocol or "TCP/IP" is a common way to transmit
        data, images, email messages, or other data files, across a computer 
        network. These messages may be divided into smaller packages, or packets
        and they may take different routes to get from point to point and may
        arrive at different times and must be reassembled at their destination.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each numbered packet is sent with a packet header indicating the sender,
        the intended recipient, the packet number and the expected number of
        packets.
    </p>
    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <p>
        I purchased three small puzzles. Each puzzle was 100 pieces, large
        enough to take a little bit of time, but small enough to be reasonably
        assembled in the time that we had in class for the demonstration. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The night before class, I had my kids assemble two of the three puzzles
        and then carefully turn them over and number each piece in order from
        top-left to bottom-right and then the puzzles were disassembled and each 
        put in a separate clear plastic bag and I removed one or two pieces at 
        random from each bag. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the two bags with the numbered puzzle pieces I added instructions to 
        turn the puzzle pieces upside down and assemble by number and to not 
        say a word.
    </p>
    <h4>Demonstration</h4>
    <p>
        I divided the (competitive) class into three groups and distributed the
        bags of puzzle pieces and asked them to wait. We talked about what they 
        knew about the puzzle pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
        They shared that without the box or a picture of the completed puzzle,
        they wouldn't know what the "message" was until it was assembled. That
        also meant they wouldn't know if there were missing piecs until they 
        finished building what they had, but decided maybe they could if they 
        counted them, but wouldn't know for sure.
    </p>
    <p>
        On "go!" I started a timer for effect and to urge their competitive spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
        They opened the bags and the two groups at the back of the class exchanged
        knowing looks when they read the instructions and quickly assembled the 
        pieces and each announced (one after another) that they had finished and 
        not only that there were pieces missing, but how many and which ones.
    </p>
    <h4>Wrap-up</h4>
    <p>
        After the confused group at the front of the class realized what had
        happened, the students made the connection back to packet transmission 
        and led the discussion, with a few leading questions from me. 
    </p>
    <p>
        They learned that the recipient could send a message receipt back to the 
        sender not only that the message was received, but also how many packets, 
        and which ones were missing, limiting the need to retransmit only those 
        packets that had been lost. And after confirmation, they could be assured 
        that they really were seeing the entire message.

    <h3>Part 2. Reflection</h3>
    <h4>Engagement</h4>
    <p>
        When writing term papers, we are told 
        <div class="ic-flash-info">
                tell 'em what you're going to tell 'em<br>
                tell 'em<br>
                tell 'em what you told 'em
        </div>
    </p>
    <h4>Thoughts</h4>
    <p>
        When lecturing, we rely on methods more than repetition to ensure what 
        is <em>sent</em> is also <em>received</em> (and understood.) 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the example, the class was small enough that a lecture might have sufficed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Going a step further, engaging students in dialog and asking leading questions
        may have kept more students involved and participating, but this comes along
        with it's own challenges, time spent when students weren't listening or 
        weren't prepared, asking the next student and the next and fielding unrelated
        or irrelevant questions and keeping the dialog on topic and on time.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this case, I also had the benefit of being in a classroom and having a
        semi-<em>captive</em> audience. Although I have had success with group challenges
        using virtual <em>breakout-rooms</em>, this example worked because of the 
        shared space.
    </p>
    <h4>Observations</h4>
    <p>
        <em>Hands-on</em> all students were involved. None were checking emails, 
        working on homework for this or other classes. None were texting or otherwise
        distracted. They all were driven to win, and all could relate to building a 
        simple puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
        There were some brief notes left on the whiteboard from the (very short) 
        discussion before the exercise, which served as reminders and cues to steer
        the students' conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Satisfaction was derived when I revealed the final slide of my lesson for
        that night and they had 
    </p>
    <h4>Application and Lessons Learned</h4>
    <p>
        This was effective because I was confident in the topic and found a way to 
        relate it to something they could easily understand. Students were 
        (regularly) responsive to the energy and excitement that I brought into the
        classroom. Even over video technology, I can usually gauge understanding
        by visual and verbal queues.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moving from the classroom to online means being more creative in keeping 
        students engaged with the instructor and also with other students, but 
        moving to an asynchronous model sometimes proves even more challenging.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the example above, all students were present and I had instant feedback 
        from their reactions to see that they were actively participating. It was 
        rewarding to find that they were able to articulate all of the planned 
        learning points.
    </p>
    <p>
        As all of the classes I am currently teaching are asynchronous, my biggest
        challenge is connection. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I spend time preparing curriculum that I hope is visually interesting 
            and easy to follow.
        </li>
        <li>
            I provide very detailed and individual feedback on assignments, focusing
            at least as much time and effort with top performers as with those
            struggling with the material.
        </li>
        <li>
            I send weekly announcements sharing questions I've received, and sometimes 
            including personal notes/ <em>"Traveling this week, here are pictures."</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            Using discussion boards. The first is mandatory, and I always include the 
            first post myself to set the tone. Another discussion board is for student
            discussions about exercises. I participate, but usually just to ask questions.
        </li>
        <li>
            My weekly office hours are an <em>open-forum</em> and are often well-attended.
            These are not prepared lessons, rather student-led discussions and Q&A sessions.
            And I often mention them in my announcements, which brings more student
            interest. 
        </li>
        <li>
            My assignments all have an unofficial 24-hour grace period. I often work 
            on projects after midnight so I don't penalize students who do also. In the 
            morning after the 1159PM due date, I set all missing assignments to 0 points
            and use Canvas to 'send message to students who...' haven't submitted assignments.
            The 0 points and the email reminders are usually enough to motivate students
            to finish, and I find I don't have to chase students or deal with frequent
            issues of turning in late work or missed assignments.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Connection. This is the greatest obstacle, and these are my approaches to closing the gap.</p>
