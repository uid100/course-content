                    You will be creating 2 relatively simple Python console 
                    applications using Python IDLE. It also gives you an 
                    opportunity to apply some of the terminology and concepts 
                    presented in chapters 1 & 2 of the textbook.

            <h3>Create Lab Folders</h3>
            <p>
                The first part of the lab is to set up your folder structure.
                Take a few minutes 
                to create a folder structure for your labs like the one shown. 
                Being organized is a critical survival skill in software 
                development. 
            </p><p>
                <em>If you are using the classroom lab computers, be sure 
                to create this on your USB drive and be sure to save to it! Saving 
                on the C: drive of the lab computers is a disaster waiting to 
                happen!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Many systems traditionally don't allow using spaces in file (and folder)
                names. This is a good practice for all of your files, but especially when 
                writing code. Lab01 is not the same as Lab 01 or Lab assignment 1. When 
                you start processing multiple data files, using spaces in file names will 
                cause unexpected problems. Learn to avoid that now.
            </p><p>
                There are 16 weeks and 12 Labs in this class. If you name your folders: 
                Lab1, Lab2, Lab3, ... then your files will sort themselves as Lab1, Lab10, 
                Lab11, Lab12, Lab2, Lab3... I suppose this is ok, but it might be 
                frustrating when you're looking for a file, so since there are more than 9
                and less than 100 labs, using two digits for the folder name makes sense.
            </p><p>
                When you submit your file (and it is called Lab01.zip) it unzips to the 
                same folder structure that I'm expecting, and it's easy for me to find, 
                and shows that you read and followed the instructions.
            </p>

            <h3>Windows or Mac?</h3>
            <p>
                This is a question that I get asked frequently. Python is supported across
                several platforms. I program on different platforms and I regularly test 
                solutions on a Windows PC, a Macbook, and a Linux computer. Many of the 
                examples have even been tested on my iPhone!
            </p>
            <p>
                For this class, either Windows or MacOS will work just fine, but you should
                choose the one that you are most comfortable with. To be successful,
                programming experience is not required, but knowledge and comfort with your
                computer is.
            </p>
            <h3>Filename Extensions</h3>
            <p>
                <em>Please don't skip this step!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we go any further, make sure that the setting to view filename
                extensions is enabled. The exact location or method to check this will
                vary between systems and even from release to release, but in general, 
                this should work.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Windows, open the File Explorer and find the <strong>View</strong> menu. 
                Set the option to <strong>Show > File Extensions</strong>. The exact location
                of this setting has changed between the last few versions of Windows, but
                this should be enough to find it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mac users, open the <strong>Finder</strong> and select <strong>Preferences</strong>
                and check <strong>Show all filename extensions</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Continue with Exercise 1.</em>

            <h2>Exercise 1 - Multiply 2 Numbers<br>
                Guided Python Application</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                For most of the labs in this class, the first exercise will be a guided 
                walk-through where we will apply the chapter concepts to develop a working 
                Python application.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this exercise, you will be guided through the steps of analyzing a 
                problem statement, writing pseudocode, and creating a working Python 
                application using Python IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning 
                Environment). Be sure to complete this exercise as you will be repeating 
                these steps and writing the same (or very similar) code for the other 
                exercises.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be aware, practice is the key here. <em>The more you do, the 
                easier it gets!</em>
            </p>
            <hr>

                This course is about program logic and design. Specifically, that means
                the <strong>approach</strong> to the problem is as important as the 
                final solution! To say that another way, <strong>the program design is 
                as important as the program</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Step one</strong> is <em>always</em> to analyze the problem and 
                figure out a plan of attack. To save time, we'll continue the problem we l
                ooked at in the chapter one lecture notes and the final problem statement 
                is pasted below for reference. Please review the chapter one notes if you 
                need to review the more detailed analysis and pseudocode.
            </p>
            <p>
                Problem statement from chapter one notes: <del>It's a bright, sunny day and 
                Cuyamaca Learning Center has hired you as a consultant to develop an 
                application that will</del> accept two input <strong>numbers</strong> 
                from the user and display the <strong>product</strong>> of the two values 
                (numbers.) Notice that the first part of that statement isn't relevant to
                the solution, so we can ignore it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Break it down into
                <ol>
                    <li>input, </li>
                    <li>process, and </li> 
                    <li>output </li>
                </ol>
                This is a simple problem and we can easily break it down into “workable pieces” 
                using this approach.
                <ul>
                    <li><em>What input do we need?</em> We need 2 numbers</li>
                    <li><em>What is our process?</em> We need to multiply the 2 numbers. <br>
                        Our formula is: product = number1 * number2</li>
                    <li><em>What is our output:</em> We need to display the product</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The next step</strong> is to write the pseudocode.

                        text editor, word processor or even as a spreadsheet, but 
                        be sure to save your work as a text file (.txt), Python IDLE 
                        can be used as well.

                    <h4>Steps</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Start Python IDLE</li>
                        <li>From the <strong>File</strong> menu, click <strong>New File</strong></li><br>
                        xxxx
                        <li>
                            Once the new file is created, save it right away as a <strong><em>text 
                            file</em></strong>. Be sure to save it in your <em>Lab01</em> folder 
                            so you get points for it!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Write your pseudocode. Keep in mind there is no single “correct” way of 
                                doing it. This is perhaps what makes writing pseudocode confusing and 
                                difficult at first. Develop a style that helps you understand the problem 
                                and how you plan to code the solution.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The sample shown below is a suggested approach. It is acceptable to
                                copy the example.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your pseudocode should be a simple set of step-by-step instructions.
                                It should list all of the steps and any calculations and constants
                                that are required for writing the code. This is your design document, 
                                but it should be simple to follow and simple to understand.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Do not submit a copy of your code. They are not the same thing.
