    <h2>Survey</h2>
    <p>Thank you for participating in this survey. Please answer the following questions:</p>
    <div id="q1">
        <h3>Question 1</h3>
        <p>
            This materials and target technology for this course is intentionally cross-platform compatible.
            I do test and verify the materials on different operating systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            So that I can better understand the diversity of the student population, please indicate the
            operating system you use most often.:
        </p>
        <!-- create an inline set of radio buttons -->
        <input type="radio" id="windows" name="os" value="windows">
        <label for="windows">Windows</label>
        <input type="radio" id="mac" name="os" value="mac">
        <label for="mac">Mac</label>
        <input type="radio" id="linux" name="os" value="linux">
        <label for="linux">Linux</label>
    </div>
    <div id="q2">
        <h3>Question 2</h3>
        <p>
            As part of preparing for the exercises in these modules, you were asked to install and configure
            the Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using the
            instructions provided in the course materials.
        </p>
        <p>
            Approximately how long did it take you to complete the installation steps?:

        <input type="radio" id="one-hour" name="one-hour" value=1>

        <label for="two-hours">&gt;2 hours</label>
    </div>
    <div id="q3">
        <h3>Question 3</h3>
        <p>
            The course materials include a series of exercises that are designed to help you learn the
            Java programming language and the Eclipse IDE. These exercises are designed to be completed
            in a specific order to build on the knowledge gained in the previous exercises.
        </p>
        <p>
            So that I can better understand the time commitment required to complete the exercises, and
            to better plan for future modules, please indicate how much time you typically spend on the
            weekly exercises.:
        </p>
        <!-- create an inline set of radio buttons -->
        <input type="radio" id="one-hour" name="one-hour" value=1>
        <label for="one-hour">&lt;1 hour</label>
        <input type="radio" id="one-to-two-hours" name="one-to-two-hours" value=2>
        <label for="one-to-two-hours">1-2 hours</label>
        <input type="radio" id="two-hours" name="two-hours" value=3>
        <label for="two-hours">&gt;2 hours</label>
    </div>
    <div id="q4">
        <h3>Question 4</h3>
        <p>
            Think about the instructions provided for the exercises. How would you rate the clarity of the
            instructions?:
        </p>
        <!-- create an inline set of radio buttons -->
        <input type="radio" id="very-clear" name="very-clear" value=1>
        <label for="very-clear">Very clear</label>
        <input type="radio" id="clear" name="clear" value=1>
        <label for="clear">Clear</label>
        <input type="radio" id="somewhat-clear" name="somewhat-clear" value=1>
        <label for="somewhat-clear">Somewhat clear</label>
        <input type="radio" id="unclear" name="unclear" value=1>
        <label for="unclear">Not at all clear</label>
    </div>
    <div id="q5">
        <h3>Question 5</h3>
        <p>
            The weekly exercises are intended to help you practice the concepts, and also to challenge your
            understanding of the material. They are designed to be <em>simple</em> (as in not complex), but
            still require you to think about the problem and how to solve it.
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, the experience of completing the exercises should be <em>challenging</em>, and
            at times, <em>mildly frustrating</em>. It is expected that sometimes you will need to ask for
            help. That is part of the learning process, part of this course, and part of the collaborative
            nature of our industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            How long is <em>long enough</em> to spend on an exercise before asking for help is a personal
            decision. However, I would like to know how long you typically spend on an exercise before
            asking for help?
