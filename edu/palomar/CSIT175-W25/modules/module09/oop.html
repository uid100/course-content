        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            To understand classes and objects, you will learn that you write <em>classes</em> to create <em>objects</em>
            but it helps to identify and discuss what an object is first, and why that matters. Along the way we'll also
            talk about a little of the history of why it matters and how it impacts software programming.
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            An <strong>object</strong>> is an instance of a <strong>class</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can start by thinkging of objects as simply things or concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab09/thing.png" </p>
        <p>
            In programming, an object is described as having:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>attributes</strong>, or characteristics, or properties and</li>
            <li><strong>behaviors</strong> or capabilities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            ...or what it <em>has</em> and what it can <em>do</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Objects that are related can be grouped together, or <em>classified</em> in certain terms or categories.
            This is where we get the term <strong>class</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will deal directly with classes, but don't lose the focus that the class is just the plan or the
            description of the objects. We don't write objects, we write classes.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h3>Object-Oriented Programming Concepts</h3>
        <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) uses objects to represent data and the operations that can be performed on
            that data. In OOP, data and behavior are combined into a single entity known as an object, which can
            communicate with other objects to perform complex tasks. The objects are instances of classes, which define
            the properties and methods that the objects can possess.</p>
        <p>One of the advantages of OOP is that it allows for the creation of modular, reusable code. By
            <strong>encapsulating</strong> data and behavior within objects, OOP helps to ensure that changes to one
            part of the program do not affect other parts of the program. This makes it easier to maintain and modify
            code over time.
        </p>
        <p>Another advantage of OOP is that it provides a natural way to model complex systems. OOP encourages the
            creation of objects that represent real-world entities, such as people, cars, or bank accounts. By modeling
            these entities as objects, OOP allows developers to create software that closely mirrors the real world,
            making it easier to understand and modify.</p>
