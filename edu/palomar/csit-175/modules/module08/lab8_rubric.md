**Rubric for Python Dictionaries Assignment**

| Criteria | Points Possible | Description |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|

### **Exercise 1: Guided Dictionary Creation (Total: 30 points)**  
| **Program Functionality** | 10 points | The program creates a dictionary, implements a user menu, and successfully calls functions to view, add, and delete data. <br> **10 points**: All functionality implemented correctly. <br> **7 points**: Minor issues with menu or functions. <br> **4 points**: Some major functionality missing. <br> **0 points**: No significant functionality. |
| **Code Structure and Logic** | 10 points | The code provided is used effectively and structured logically. <br> **10 points**: Code is well-structured and efficiently utilizes provided code. <br> **7 points**: Code structure is mostly correct with some inefficiencies. <br> **4 points**: Code structure is disorganized or hard to follow. <br> **0 points**: Little or no logical structure. |
| **Use of Functions** | 5 points | Separate functions are used to view, add, and delete data from the dictionary. <br> **5 points**: Functions correctly implemented and called. <br> **3 points**: Functions partially implemented. <br> **0 points**: Functions not implemented. |
| **Good Coding Conventions** | 5 points | Meaningful identifier names are used, and the code follows proper conventions (no hard-coded values). <br> **5 points**: No hard-coded values, good identifier names. <br> **3 points**: Some hard-coded values, inconsistent naming. <br> **0 points**: Many hard-coded values, poor naming. |

### **Exercise 2: Complex Dictionaries and File Templates (Total: 30 points)**  
| **Program Functionality** | 15 points | The program correctly extends the provided code, implements complex dictionaries, and demonstrates additional data inputs using templates. <br> **15 points**: All functionality and templates correctly implemented. <br> **10 points**: Minor issues with data input or template usage. <br> **5 points**: Some major functionality or template usage missing. <br> **0 points**: No significant functionality implemented. |
| **Data Input and Handling** | 10 points | The program handles data input dynamically and uses dictionary structures effectively. <br> **10 points**: Data input and handling is correct and efficient. <br> **7 points**: Minor issues with data handling. <br> **4 points**: Significant issues with data handling or incorrect data input. <br> **0 points**: No meaningful data handling. |
| **Good Coding Conventions** | 5 points | Code uses appropriate naming and no hard-coded values. <br> **5 points**: Strong naming conventions, no hard-coded values. <br> **3 points**: Inconsistent naming or some hard-coded values. <br> **0 points**: Poor naming or heavy reliance on hard-coded values. |

### **Exercise 3: Reading from Files to Dictionaries (Total: 40 points)**  
| **Completion of Missing Code** | 20 points | The missing lines of code are correctly implemented to read from text files and populate the dictionary. <br> **20 points**: All missing code completed correctly. <br> **15 points**: Minor issues with the implemented code. <br> **10 points**: Several issues or incomplete code. <br> **0 points**: No code implemented. |
| **File Reading and Writing to Dictionary** | 15 points | The program correctly reads from the supplied text files and stores data into a dictionary, using that data to retrieve user-requested information. <br> **15 points**: File reading and writing is fully functional. <br> **10 points**: Minor issues with reading or storing data. <br> **5 points**: Major issues with reading files or storing data in the dictionary. <br> **0 points**: No file reading or data storage. |
| **Good Coding Conventions** | 5 points | Code follows proper naming conventions and avoids hard-coded values. <br> **5 points**: Strong naming conventions, no hard-coded values. <br> **3 points**: Some inconsistencies in naming or some hard-coded values. <br> **0 points**: Poor naming or heavy reliance on hard-coded values. |

**Total Possible Points**: 100
