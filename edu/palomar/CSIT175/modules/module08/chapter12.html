    <h2 class="alert alert-info">Chapter 12 How to work with dictionaries</h2>

    <p>
        A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and associated with a value.
    </p>
    <ul>
        Dictionaries are
        <li>mutable,</li>
        <li>unordered,</li>
        <li>and can contain any data type as values.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="ic-flash-info">
        <strong><em>Mutable</em></strong> refers to the ability of an object to be changed after it is created. In the
        context of dictionaries, being mutable means that you can modify the contents of the dictionary after it has
        been created. This includes adding new key-value pairs, updating existing values associated with keys, and
        removing key-value pairs
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="ic-flash-info">
        In Python, dictionaries are considered <strong><em>unordered</em></strong> data structures. This means that the
        elements in a dictionary do not have a defined order. Unlike sequences such as lists or tuples, where elements
        are stored in a specific order and accessed by index, the items in a dictionary are stored and retrieved by
        their keys, and their order is not guaranteed. When you iterate over a dictionary or print its contents, you
        might observe that the items are not necessarily displayed in the same order in which they were inserted.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>Creating Dictionaries</h3>
    <p>
        In Python, dictionaries are created using curly braces <code>{}</code>. You can initialize an empty dictionary
        or
        populate it with key-value pairs:</p>

    <pre><code>
# Creating an empty dictionary
my_dict = {}

# Creating a dictionary with initial key-value pairs
my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
</code></pre>

    <h3>Accessing, Setting, Adding, and Deleting Items</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessing:</strong> You can access the value associated with a key using square brackets
            <code>[]</code> or the <code>get()</code> method.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Setting:</strong> To set or update the value associated with a key, simply assign a new value to
            that key.</li>
        <li><strong>Adding:</strong> To add a new key-value pair, simply assign a value to a new key.</li>
        <li><strong>Deleting:</strong> You can remove a key-value pair using the <code>del</code> keyword or the
            <code>pop()</code> method.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Looping Through Keys and Values</h3>
    <p>You can iterate through a dictionary's keys, values, or key-value pairs using loops or methods like
        <code>keys()</code>, <code>values()</code>, and <code>items()</code>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
# Looping through keys
for key in my_dict:
    print(key)

# Looping through values
for value in my_dict.values():
    print(value)

# Looping through key-value pairs
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)
</code></pre>

    <h3>Converting Between Dictionaries and Lists</h3>
    <p>You can convert dictionaries to lists using methods like <code>list()</code> and <code>dict()</code> to convert
        lists to dictionaries. When converting a dictionary to a list, you can choose to convert keys, values, or
        key-value pairs.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Differences Between Dictionaries and Lists</h2>
    <p>While both dictionaries and lists are used to store collections of data, they have different characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dictionaries use key-value pairs for data storage, while lists use ordered sequences of elements.</li>
        <li>Dictionaries are unordered, so the order of items is not guaranteed, whereas lists maintain the order of
            elements.</li>
        <li>Dictionaries are preferred when data needs to be accessed quickly using unique keys, while lists are
            suitable for maintaining an ordered collection of items.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="alert alert-info">Dictionaries vs JSON</h2>
    <p>
        In a previous module we looked at JSON-formatted data files, key-value pairs which looked very similar to this,
        but with some important differences.
    </p>
    <h2>Comparison: Python Dictionaries vs. JSON</h2>

    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <p>Python dictionaries are defined using curly braces <code>{}</code> and colons <code>:</code> to separate keys and
        values. JSON uses a similar syntax but with double quotes <code>"</code> around keys and values.</p>

    <h3>Data Types</h3>
    <p>Python dictionaries can contain any data type as keys or values, including integers, strings, lists, tuples,
        other dictionaries, etc. JSON supports a subset of the data types available in Python, including strings,
        numbers, booleans, arrays (lists in Python), and objects (equivalent to Python dictionaries).</p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>Python dictionaries are a built-in data type used within Python programs to store and manipulate data. JSON is a
        lightweight data interchange format used for transmitting data between a server and a web application, or
        between different systems. It is language-independent and widely used for representing structured data.</p>

    <h3>Serialization and Deserialization</h3>
    <p>Python dictionaries can be easily converted to JSON strings using the <code>json.dumps()</code> function from the
        <code>json</code> module, and JSON strings can be parsed into Python dictionaries using
        <code>json.loads()</code>. This process is known as serialization (converting Python objects to JSON) and
        deserialization (converting JSON back to Python objects).
    </p>

    <h3>Ordering</h3>
    <p>Python dictionaries are unordered, meaning they do not preserve the order of elements. JSON objects, on the other
        hand, are ordered collections of key-value pairs, meaning the order of elements is preserved when converting
        between JSON and Python dictionaries.</p>
