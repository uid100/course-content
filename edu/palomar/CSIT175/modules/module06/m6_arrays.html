        <h2 class="alert">Arrays</h2>

        <h3>Variable type</h3>
        <p>An array is a fundamental data structure in programming that allows you to store a collection of elements of
            the same type under a single variable name. Arrays are commonly used for organizing and manipulating data
            efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep the <strong>variable</strong> discussion in mind. An array is first and most importantly, a variable
            type! So it must have a known size and set of rules, and must address a location in memory.
        </p>
        <h4 style="font-style: italic;">
            How much space do I need?
        </h4>
        <p>
            All elements of an array must be the same type (and size!), and the number of elements must be known when it
            is declared. When the compiler identifies the space required for any variable, it needs to know how much
            space is required.
        </p>
        <h4 style="font-style: italic;">
            An array is stored in <strong>contiguous</strong> memory
        </h4>
        <p>
            The application will map any variable to an actual location in memory. Arrays are no different. The address
            of an array maps to the start of the block of memory reserved to store its data. Since each element is the
            same size (type), if the first element is stored at the start of the block, finding the second one is simply
            a matter of moving through the memory, past exactly the size of the first element. Getting to the third
            means starting from the beginning and going past the first two (2) elements. In code, we call this the index
            of the array element. So, <code>myArray[5]</code> is referring to an element located past the first 5 items
            counted from the beginning of the memory block, or the sixth element.
        </p>

        <h3>Declaring Arrays</h3>
        <p>
            <em>In most programming languages,</em> arrays are declared by specifying the data type of the elements they
            will contain, followed by the array name and the size of the array (number of elements).
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Why?</em> Because the application has to know how much space it needs.
        </p>

        <h3>Assigning Values to Arrays</h3>
        <p>
            Once declared, you can assign values to individual elements of the array using indexing. Indexing starts at
            0
            for the first element and goes up to the size of the array minus one.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>index</em> is also called the <em>subscript</em>. Since a variable name refers to the address of its
            location in memory, the array name points to the base address and the index is the
            <strong><em>offset</em></strong> from that base address. If you count (offset) past the number of elements
            that are contained in an array, then you've gone past the last item. That's why the location of the last
            item has to be the count minus one. <code>n - 1</code>
        </p>

        <h3>Storing and Retrieving Elements</h3>
        <p>Elements in an array are stored sequentially in memory, allowing for fast access based on their index. You
            can retrieve elements by specifying their index within square brackets.</p>
        <pre><code>
        // Retrieving elements from the array in Python
        myArray = [10, 20, 30]
        print(myArray[0])  # Output: 10
        print(myArray[2])  # Output: 30
            </code></pre>

        <p>Arrays provide a convenient and efficient way to work with collections of data in programming, making them a
            valuable tool for various tasks.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            These rules for how to create and use arrays are important, but if you understand how arrays work, then the
            <em>why</em> they work will make sense, and the rules will make more sense.
