        <p>
            As you have seen there are different ways of hosting and presenting data on the web and many types of
            services running on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            As REST APIs commonly support CRUD operations, most require a user to be registered to use the service,
            often for a fee. A simple web search will reveal many sources of free APIs that do not require an API_Key to
            interact and access. You can search for some.

        <p>
            There is a vast amount of data available on the internet. After investigating some of these APIs:
        <ul>
            <li>Propose an application (or more than one) that could make use of at least 3 of these APIs.
                <ul>
                    <li>Who would be the target audience (user group)?</li>
                    <li>Would this appeal to a large group of users or only be of special interest to a select few
                        individuals?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                (30 points) In the space below, add your post, with at least 2 good paragraphs describing your ideas,
                and why you think any of these might be an interesting project.<br />
                <span style="background-color: yellow;">
                    You should have your initial post complete by Friday night, to give other students an opportunity to
                    respond.

            </li>
            <li>
                (5+5+5+5 points) After posting, add a thoughtful response to <strong>at least four (4)</strong> other
                student posts, expanding or questions ideas from their posts. Your replies should be thoughtful,
                meaningful, and respectful class discussion replies of at least a paragraph. Be constructive, stay on
                topic. I'm looking for something more meaningful than "great job" and "I agree."
