            There are a number of methodologies associated with the software development lifecycle, but all are
            concerned with the roughly the same basic phases or stages.

            Read the assigned chapter, watch the embedded video, and read the (short) linked blog entry about the cost
            of finding and fixing defects.

            You have seen there are many phases and stages of software testing and that testing activities are
            continuous throughout the software project. The linked blog post highlights the cost impact and
            differentials of defects over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking all of this into consideration, what do you think the software programmer's role is in ensuring a
            quality software product, and what are some of the steps and activities a programmer should do with a
            defect-free, quality product as an objective?
        </p>
        <p>
            (30 points) In the space below, add your post, with at least 2 paragraphs describing the programmer's
            activities and their contribution to the testing effort.
        </p>
        <p style="background-color: yellow;">
            You should have your initial post complete by Friday night, to give other students an opportunity to
            respond.
        </p>
        <p>
            (10+10 points) After posting, add a thoughtful response to at least two other student posts. Your replies
            should be thoughtful, meaningful, and respectful class discussion replies of at least a paragraph. Be
            constructive, stay on topic. I'm looking for something more meaningful than "great job" and "I agree."
