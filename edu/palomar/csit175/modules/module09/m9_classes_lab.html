        <div id="introduction">
            <p>This lab provides an opportunity to apply the concepts and principles presented in the textbook.</p>
            <p>Since we&rsquo;re spending 2 weeks on this chapter, there are 2 guided exercises (1 for each week) to
                give some hands on experience creating user defined classes in Python.</p>
            <p class="ic-flash-info">
                In week 2 we'll talk about instance variables and class variables. You'll need this for exercises 3&4.
            </p>
            <p>We will create class models and then code the classes in Python as well as implement a simple test
                fixture application where we can make sure the class functions as specified and coded. In real world
                software development, it is a common practice to test custom classes this way before integrating into a
                large scale project because it makes testing and debugging a whole lot easier. Once you complete the
                guided exercises, you will get a couple user defined classes to code on your own.</p>

            <h2 class="alert">Exercise 1</h2>
            <h3>Magazine Subscription class</h3>
            <p>This first exercise will be for a magazine subscription class. To keep things quick and simple, there are
                just a few properties given in the exercise. In a real
                world application, there would probably be quite a few more. When designing user defined classes, UML
                class models are used to define the class. We&rsquo;ll create these using Draw.io. We&rsquo;ll cover the
                Unified Modeling Language (UML) in more detail later.</p>
            <div id="class-model">
                <h3>Creating the Class Model</h3>
                <div class="ic-flash-alert">
                    <p>The Class model is a software component design diagram that is <em>one of</em> the diagrams in
                        the Unified
                        Modeling Language (UML) standard.</p>
                    <p>The Class model is not a flowchart.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Navigate a web browser to draw.io, select Blank Diagram and click the Create button. You can save to
                    a file later.</p>
                <p>Scroll down to UML and click the arrow to expand the palette.</p>
                <p>Locate Class in the tool palette, drag and drop a class template onto the page.</p>

                <p>Notice that a class is split into 3 compartments. The top
                    compartment is the class name, the middle compartment contains the attributes or properties, and the
                    bottom contains the methods or operations. Click inside each compartment and edit as needed.
                    We&rsquo;ll shorten the class name to Magazine to save some typing.</p>
                <p>For attributes and methods, a minus (-) prefix means that member is private and a plus (+) indicates
                    public. Attributes are normally declared private and methods are normally public unless they are
                    used only in the internal workings of the class.</p>
                <p>Optionally, you can specify the data type as shown in the sample Magazine class below.</p>
                <p>We&rsquo;ll have a method called toString() that will return a formatted string of the subscriber
                    name, magazine title and months remaining.</p>
                <p>The book also shows the getters and setters in the methods compartment. Some software developers omit
                    these in a class model because it&rsquo;s a given they exist and, if there&rsquo;s a large number,
                    they can make a class model very large and unwieldy in a hurry. If you want to add the getter and
                    setter methods in, that&rsquo;s perfectly fine.</p>
                <p>You can click on each individual compartment and make larger or smaller as needed.</p>
                <p>Your completed Magazine class should look (roughly) something like this:</p>
                <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab09/MagazineClassModel.png"
                        alt="magazine class model" /></p>
                <p>Be sure to save your work. Export the <em>MagazineClassModel</em> as a jpg and save it in your Lab
                    folder.</p>

                <h3>Python Code for the Magazine Exercise</h3>
                <p>Create a new <code>Magazine.py</code> file.</p>
                <p>When coding your class in Python, use your class model as a &ldquo;cheat sheet&rdquo;. This is why we
                    did all the work of creating it! Keep in mind some of the Python demo code in the lecture notes. Is
                    there something there you could <em>borrow</em> from? You are given the code for this exercise.</p>
                <p>Note the use of the <code>this</code> reference throughout the code, although it is referred to as
                    <code>self</code> in Python.
                </p>

                <hr />
                <h3>Code a <em>Test Fixture</em> for the <strong>Magazine</strong> class</h3>
                <p>The next step is to code a test fixture where we can create an instance, set the various properties
                    and make sure things work as expected.</p>
                <p>You are given the code for <code>MagazineTest.py</code>.</p>
                <p>Be sure that your <code>Magazine.py</code> file is in the same folder. And watch your capitalization.
                    "Magazine" is not the same as "magazine."</p>

            <h2 class="alert">Exercise 2</h2>
            <h3>Pizza Demo</h3>
            <p> To prepare you for an upcoming lab
                exercise, we&rsquo;ll add a quantity property in addition to the toppings, size and price properties
                given in the text. Instead of a numeric size (i.e. 12 inches, etc.), we&rsquo;ll go with small, medium
                and large for sizes so size will be a string value instead of a numeric type. We&rsquo;ll also add a
                <code>calculatePrice()</code> instance method. Another thing to notice is that <code>price</code> will
                be a read-only property.
            </p>
            <p>When we set the size property, we will look up and set the price. We&rsquo;ll go through all the same
                steps as the magazine exercise although things won&rsquo;t be quite as detailed this time around.</p>
            <h3>Pizza Class Model</h3>
            <p>Using draw.io, open the class model you completed for the previous exercise. Add a Pizza class to the
                page. Our class model should look something like this:</p>
            <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab09/PizzaClassModel.png"
                    alt="Pizza class model" /></p>
            <p>A helpful embellishment to our methods is the return type of each method.</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Coding the Pizza Class</h3>
            <p>Create a new Python file called <code>Pizza.py</code> and a new class called <code>Pizza</code>. Refer to
                the last exercise if you need detailed instructions on how to create a class, implement the properties,
                constructors, getters/setters, etc. Note the validation code added to <code>setQty()</code> and how
                <code>setSize()</code> also sets the price.
            </p>
            <p><img src="/courses/49289/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/lab09/PizzaClass.png"
                    alt="Pizza class source code" /></p>
            <p>Head&rsquo;s up, there are a few twists this time. The first one is that you&rsquo;ll need to copy the
                <code>Methods.py</code> file you created in Lab 6. You will be reusing the <code>find_string()</code>
                method. Import it to your <code>Pizza.py</code> file.
            </p>

            <p>Be sure to test your code!</p>

            <h3>Checking Account</h3>
            <p>In this exercise, you will design and build an application that allows the user to enter information for
                a checking account and then display it.</p>
            <p>To do this, you will create a new class called <code>CheckingAccount</code> that will contain properties
                for the account number, customer name, customer address and account balance.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Complete a class model in draw.io. Save it as <code>CheckingAccount_ClassModel.jpg</code></li>
                <li>Create a Python code file in your Lab07 folder called CheckingAccount.py</li>
                <li>Code a constructor, getter methods, setter methods, the to_string() method</li>
                <li>Add methods: credit() and debit(). (You may call these deposit() and withdraw() if you prefer.)</li>
                <li>The to_string() method must return a formatted string with the values for all the properties above.
                </li>
                <li>Create a new Python code file called <code>CheckingAccountTest.py</code>. This will be the test
                    fixture application.</li>
                <li>Your test fixture code will have prompts for customer name and address. Additionally, you must have
                    a prompt to debit an amount and a prompt to credit the account.</li>
                <li>
                    We'll use the constructor to set the account_number and set the initial balance to $0.00
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the to_string() method to display the account information.</li>
                <li>Be sure to test your work.</li>

            <h3 class="alert alert-info">Burgers!!!</h3>
            <p>This exercise is very similar to the first exercise and the pizza demo. You will create a custom class
                called <code>Burger</code> that will have the following properties: Customer name, order No., burger
                type, quantity ordered and price. You will implement get() and set() methods for these along with a
                constructor.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Complete a class model in draw.io. Export the image to jpg and name it
                    <code>Burger_ClassModel.jpg</code>.
                </li>
                <li>Create a new Python file and class called Burger. Review the steps and code in the previous
                    exercises, if needed.</li>
                <li>Implement an appropriate constructor, getter methods and setter methods.</li>
                <li>Price is computed based on the type of burger ordered and then multipled by the quantity ordered.
                    There is no sales tax. Burger types and prices are in the table below. There is room to be creative
                    if you want to use some favorites of your own.
                    <table class="table table-bordered">

                </li>
                <li>Implement a public method called <code>to_string()</code> that will return a string containing
                    customer name, order No., type, qty, and total price.</li>
                <li>Create a new Python code file called <code>BurgerTest.py</code>. It must prompt for customer name,
                    order No., burger type, and quantity ordered.</li>
                <li>Test your application. Make sure it calculates properly for each burger type. Test with quantities
                    greater than 1 to make sure the extended price (price * qty) is calculating properly.</li>
