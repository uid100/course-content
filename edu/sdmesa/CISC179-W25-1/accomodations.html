    <dd><span>If you are a Mesa College student who has a disability (either permanent or temporary) or medical
            condition that impacts learning, we encourage you to meet with a DSPS Counselor to determine the
            accommodations that are appropriate for you. To be eligible, you will need to provide documentation of your
            disability or medical condition. If you are unable to provide verification but believe you would benefit
            from having academic accommodations, you are still encouraged to apply for services. Your application will
            be reviewed and you will be contacted by the DSPS Office.&nbsp;</span>.</dd>
