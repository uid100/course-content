            <dd>The first edition of the textbook is an acceptable substitute, and used copies may be found at a
                discount.</dd>
            <dd>Students are encouraged to find the textbook as early as possible, but it is reasonable to expect that
                students may not have the textbook for up to 2 weeks.</dd>
