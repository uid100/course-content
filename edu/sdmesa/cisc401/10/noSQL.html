        <h1>NoSQL Databases</h1>
        <p>
            A NoSQL databases is a flexible alternative to traditional relational databases.</p>
        <p>
            Unlike SQL databases, which rely on structured tables and predefined schemas, NoSQL databases provide a way
            to store and manage unstructured or semi-structured data, making them ideal for handling large-scale,
            distributed systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            They are designed to scale horizontally and offer high performance, making them a popular choice for modern
            applications that require flexibility, speed, and scalability.
        </p>
        <p>
            NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL," indicating that these databases may support SQL-like query languages in
            addition to other data models. They come in various types, including document databases, key-value stores,
            column-family stores, and graph databases, each suited for different use cases.

        <h2>Key Characteristics of NoSQL Databases</h2>
        <p>Key characteristics of NoSQL databases include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Schema flexibility</strong><br>
                NoSQL databases allow for dynamic schemas, enabling you to store data without a predefined
                structure.<br>
                They use a flexible schema model that can support a variety of data types and formats.</li>
            <li><strong>Distributed architecture</strong><br>
                Unlike relational databases, NoSQL architecture can be made up of multiple machines working together.
            </li>
            <li><strong>High scalability and availability</strong><br>
                They are designed to scale <em>out</em> by adding more hardware to a system, as opposed to scaling
                <em>up</em> by adding more resources to an existing server.

        <h2>Types of NoSQL Databases</h2>
        <p>NoSQL databases come in various forms, each suited for different types of data models and use cases. Let's
            dive
            into the main types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Document Databases</strong><br>
                Store data in documents (e.g., JSON, BSON). Each document is independent, allowing flexibility in data
                structure.<br>
                Example: MongoDB.</li>
            <li><strong>Key-Value Stores</strong><br>
                Store data as a collection of key-value pairs. Useful for simple,
                fast lookups.<br>
                Example: Redis.</li>
            <li><strong>Column-Family Stores</strong><br>
                Organize data in columns rather than rows, which is beneficial for handling large volumes of data.<br>
                Example: Apache Cassandra.</li>
            <li><strong>Graph Databases</strong><br>
                Focus on relationships between entities, storing data in nodes and edges. Ideal for complex relationship
                modeling.<br>
                Example: Neo4j.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Use Cases for NoSQL in Healthcare</h2>
        <p>NoSQL databases offer powerful solutions to the unique challenges in healthcare, where data is often complex,
            heterogeneous, and voluminous. Key use cases include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Electronic Health Records (EHR)</strong><br>
                Storing patient records with flexible schemas that can evolve over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical IoT Data</strong><br>
                Handling sensor data from wearable devices and medical equipment, which generates large streams of
                real-time information.</li>
            <li><strong>Genomic Data</strong><br>
                Managing massive datasets for research and precision medicine, where
                relationships between genes and clinical information can be explored.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare Analytics</strong><br>
                Powering analytics applications to improve patient care, optimize
                hospital operations, and support predictive modeling.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hands-On: Setting up and Querying a NoSQL Database</h2>
        <p>
            Set up a NoSQL database using MongoDB, a popular <em>document-based</em>
            NoSQL system. Follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Installation</strong><br>
                Install MongoDB on your machine, or use a cloud-hosted solution like MongoDB Atlas.</li>
            <li><strong>Creating a Database</strong><br>
                Once installed, create a database using the <code>use</code> command:
                <pre>use healthcareDB</pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Inserting Documents</strong><br>
                Insert patient records as JSON-like documents:
                <pre>db.patients.insertOne({
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 45,
    condition: "Hypertension",
    medications: ["Lisinopril", "Aspirin"]
})</pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Querying Data</strong><br>
                Perform basic queries to retrieve patient information:
                <pre>db.patients.find({ age: { $gte: 40 } })</pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Aggregation</strong><br>
                Use aggregation queries to analyze the data:
                <pre>db.patients.aggregate([
    { $match: { condition: "Hypertension" } },
    { $group: { _id: null, avgAge: { $avg: "$age" } } }
])</pre>
            </li>
        </ol>
