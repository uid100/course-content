    <h1>Introduction to NoSQL Databases</h1>
    <p>
        NoSQL databases have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional relational databases, offering flexible
        and scalable solutions for modern data storage needs. Unlike relational databases that rely on structured
        schemas and SQL queries, NoSQL databases support various data models, including document, key-value,
        column-family, and graph structures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Designed to handle the vast amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data generated by web applications, big
        data systems, and distributed environments, NoSQL databases prioritize horizontal scalability, high
        availability, and flexibility. As data needs grow more complex, NoSQL databases provide developers with the
        tools to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.

    <p>
        In this discussion, we will explore the key characteristics, types, and benefits of NoSQL databases, along with
        use cases that highlight their importance in todayâ€™s technology landscape.
