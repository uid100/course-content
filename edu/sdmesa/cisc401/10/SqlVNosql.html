    <h1>SQL vs NoSQL</h1>
    <p>
        SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating
        data. They are based on a table structure with rows and columns, where each row represents a record and each
        column represents a field in the record.
    </p>
    <p>
        NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that provide a flexible alternative to
        traditional SQL databases. They are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and can scale
        horizontally to accommodate large volumes of data and high traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
        While SQL databases are ideal for applications that require complex queries and transactions, NoSQL databases
        are better suited for applications that require flexibility, speed, and scalability. NoSQL databases come in
        various types, including document databases, key-value stores, column-family stores, and graph databases, each
        tailored to different use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        In summary, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of your application,
        such as the type of data you need to store, the volume of data, and the performance and scalability needs of
        your application.
