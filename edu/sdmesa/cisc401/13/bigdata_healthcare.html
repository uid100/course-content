                    As we have seen and discussed, <em>Big Data</em> derives its value from its analysis. In healthcare,
                    the
                    potential for big data to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and improve the quality of care is
                    significant. The ability to collect, store, and analyze vast amounts of data from a variety of
                    sources will
                    transform the healthcare industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Big Data includes collection, storage, processing, analysis, and visualization of vast amounts of
                    data. Each of
                    these is a challenge in itself. The promise of big data is that it will enable us to make better
                    decisions.
                    But the news is filled with stories about how big data, machine learning, and artificial
                    intelligence are
                    changing the future.

                    Traditional medicine is based on observation and experience. A patient relies on the expertise of a
                    doctor, who
                    in turn relies on his or her own experience and knowledge. The doctor may consult with other doctors
                    or
                    specialists, but the decision-making process is largely based on the doctor's own experience and
                    knowledge, and
                    a limited amount of data.

                    Predictive analytics is the process of using data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning
                    techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data. The goal is to go
                    beyond knowing what has happened to providing a best assessment of what will happen in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Predictive analytics is used in a variety of industries, including healthcare, insurance, finance,
                    marketing, and more. In healthcare, predictive analytics can help providers identify patients who
                    are at risk for certain conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer, and intervene before
                    the condition becomes serious.
