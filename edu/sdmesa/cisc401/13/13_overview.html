    <h1>Big Data in Healthcare</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Big data is a term that describes the large volume of data – both structured and unstructured – that inundates a
        business on a day-to-day basis. But it’s not the amount of data that’s important. It’s what organizations do
        with
        the data that matters. Big data can be analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic
        business
        moves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Big data analytics is the process of examining large and varied data sets – i.e., big data – to uncover hidden
        patterns, unknown correlations, market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information that can help
        organizations make more-informed business decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Big data analytics can help organizations to better understand the information contained within the data and
        will
        also help identify the data that is most important to the business and future business decisions. Analysts
        working
        with big data typically want the knowledge that comes from analyzing the data.
