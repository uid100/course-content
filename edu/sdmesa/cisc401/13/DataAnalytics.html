                    Big data analytics is the process of examining large and varied data sets - i.e., big data - to
                    uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, market trends, customer preferences, and other useful
                    information that can help organizations make more-informed business decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Big data analytics can help organizations to better understand the information contained within the
                    data and will also help identify the data that is most important to the business and future business
                    decisions. Analysts working with big data typically want the knowledge that comes from analyzing the
                    data.

                <p style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:10px;">
                    Analytics is the difference between data and information.

                    Several tools are commonly used to manage and analyze big data:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hadoop: An open-source framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets
                        across clusters of computers using simple programming models.</li>
                    <li>Spark: A unified analytics engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming,
                        SQL, machine learning, and graph processing.</li>
                    <li>NoSQL Databases: Such as MongoDB and Cassandra, which are designed to handle unstructured data
                        and provide high scalability.</li>
                    <li>Data Lakes: Storage repositories that hold vast amounts of raw data in its native format until
                        it is needed.</li>
                    <li>Data Warehouses: Central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources,
                        used
                        for reporting and data analysis.</li>
                    <li>Visualization Tools: Like Tableau and Power BI, which help in creating interactive and shareable
                        dashboards</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Hadoop is an open-source software framework for storing data and running applications on
                        clusters
                        of commodity hardware. It provides massive storage for any kind of data, enormous processing
                        power, and the ability to handle virtually limitless concurrent tasks or jobs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hadoop is designed to scale up from a single server to thousands of machines, with a very high
                        degree of fault tolerance. Rather than relying on high-end hardware, the resiliency of these
                        clusters comes from the softwareâ€™s ability to detect and handle failures at the application
                        layer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hadoop is composed of four main modules:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hadoop Common: The common utilities that support the other Hadoop modules.</li>
                        <li>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): A distributed file system that provides
                            high-throughput
                            access to application data.</li>
                        <li>Hadoop YARN: A framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.</li>
                        <li>Hadoop MapReduce: A YARN-based system for parallel processing of large data sets.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
