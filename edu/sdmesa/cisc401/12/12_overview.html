    <h1>Database Applications</h1>
    <h2>Computer program design</h2>
    <p>
        Computer programs are often categorized by their user interface. These include:
    <ul>
        <li>Command-line programs</li>
        <li>Graphical user interfaces (GUIs)</li>
        <li>Web applications</li>
        <li>Mobile applications</li>
        <li>Headless or embedded</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Any of these programs may be designed to interact with a database. The database can be local or remote, and
        accessed directly or through a web service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Database applications are essential tools for managing, storing, and retrieving data, which serve as the
        backbone of modern software systems across diverse domains. These applications enable users and systems to
        efficiently handle large volumes of structured data and provide powerful querying and reporting capabilities
        that support decision-making processes. Database applications can vary significantly, from small, single-user
        databases to large-scale, distributed systems that manage critical information for organizations.
