    <h1>Health Level 7 (HL7)</h1>
    <p>Health Level 7 (HL7) is a set of international standards for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of
        electronic health information. These standards are created by the Health Level Seven International, an
        organization dedicated to providing a comprehensive framework and related standards for the exchange,
        integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information. HL7 standards aim to improve
        interoperability between healthcare systems, allowing different systems to communicate with each other
        effectively. This includes standards for:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Messaging:</strong> Guidelines for the exchange of clinical data.</li>
        <li><strong>Documents:</strong> Formats for clinical documents such as discharge summaries and medical records.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Application Interfaces:</strong> Standards for integrating different healthcare applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Terminologies:</strong> Standardized vocabularies and codes for medical concepts and procedures.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>HL7 standards play a crucial role in enabling efficient and accurate electronic health information exchange,
        ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes.</p>
