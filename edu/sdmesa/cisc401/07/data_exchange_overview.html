    <h1>Data Integration</h1>
    <p>
        In this module, we are going to consider the concept of data integration and its importance in the context of
        healthcare.

        Data integration refers to the process of combining data from different sources into a
        unified view or dataset.

        This enables organizations to have access to accurate and comprehensive information. In the healthcare industry,
        data integration plays a crucial role in improving patient care, enhancing operational efficiency, and enabling
        better decision-making.

        The healthcare industry is known for its use of acronyms and technical jargon, and data integration is no
        exception. Some of the key terms and standards you will encounter in this module include Health Information
        Exchange (HIE), Health Level 7 (HL7), and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Let's take a closer
        look at each of these concepts.

    <h2>Data Integration and Exchange Concepts</h2>
    <p>
        Before we look at the specifics of <strong>HIE, HL7, and FHIR,</strong> let's start with some basic definitions
        and concepts related to data integration and exchange.
