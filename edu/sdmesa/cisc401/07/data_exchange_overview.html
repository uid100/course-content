    <h1>Data Integration</h1>
    <p>
        In this module, we are going to consider the concept of data integration and its importance in the context of
        healthcare.
    </p>
    <p>
    <blockquote>
        Data integration refers to the process of combining data from different sources into a
        unified view or dataset.
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        This enables organizations to have access to accurate and comprehensive information. In the healthcare industry,
        data integration plays a crucial role in improving patient care, enhancing operational efficiency, and enabling
        better decision-making.

    <p>
        As part of this discussion, we are going to be wading in some <em>acronym soup.</em>

        The healthcare industry is known for its use of acronyms and technical jargon, and data integration is no
        exception. Some of the key terms and standards you will encounter in this module include Health Information
        Exchange (HIE), Health Level 7 (HL7), and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Let's take a closer
        look at each of these concepts.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Integration and Exchange Concepts</h2>
    <p>
        Before we look at the specifics of <strong>HIE, HL7, and FHIR,</strong> let's start with some basic definitions
        and concepts related to data integration and exchange.
    </p>


    <h2>Health Level 7 (HL7)</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Health Level 7 (HL7)</strong> is a set of international standards for the exchange, integration,
        sharing,
        and retrieval of electronic health information. HL7 standards support clinical practice and the management,
        delivery, and evaluation of healthcare services. By using HL7 standards, healthcare organizations can ensure
        interoperability between different systems and improve the efficiency of data exchange.
    </p>
    <h2>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</strong> is a standard for exchanging healthcare
        information electronically. FHIR is designed to enable the exchange of healthcare data between different systems
        and applications in a fast, secure, and interoperable manner. FHIR uses modern web technologies and APIs to
        provide a flexible and scalable approach to healthcare data exchange.

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>
        Understand the mechanisms and standards that enable data integration and exchange in the healthcare industry
        including Health Information Exchange (HIE), Health Level 7 (HL7), and Fast Healthcare Interoperability
        Resources (FHIR).
