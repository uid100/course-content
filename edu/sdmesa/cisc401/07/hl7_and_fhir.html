    <h2>Health Level 7 (HL7)</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Health Level 7 (HL7)</strong> is a standards organization with an established set of international
        standards for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information. HL7 standards
        support clinical practice and the management, delivery, and evaluation of healthcare services. By using HL7
        standards, healthcare organizations can ensure interoperability between different systems and improve the
        efficiency of data exchange.

    <h3>OSI model</h3>
    <p>
        The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a
        telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose and
        interacts with the adjacent layers to provide a cohesive set of services. The OSI model is not a protocol in
        itself,
        but rather a model that helps guide the development of protocols and standards that enable different systems to
        communicate with each other.

    <p>
        HL7 gets its name from the seventh layer of the OSI model, which is the application layer. The application layer
        provides network services directly to end-user applications. In the context of HL7, the application layer
        represents the interface between healthcare applications and the underlying network infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some common standards developed by HL7 include HL7 Version 2.x, HL7 Version 3, and the Clinical Document
        Architecture (CDA). These standards define the structure and content of messages exchanged between healthcare
        systems, ensuring that data is transmitted accurately and consistently.

    <h2>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</strong> is a standard for exchanging healthcare
        information electronically. FHIR is designed to enable the exchange of healthcare data between different systems
        and applications in a fast, secure, and interoperable manner. FHIR uses modern web technologies and APIs to
        provide a flexible and scalable approach to healthcare data exchange.
