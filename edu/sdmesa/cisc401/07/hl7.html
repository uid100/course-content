    <h2>Health Level 7 (HL7)</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Health Level 7 (HL7)</strong> is a standards organization with an established set of international
        standards for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information. HL7 standards
        support clinical practice and the management, delivery, and evaluation of healthcare services. By using HL7
        standards, healthcare organizations can ensure interoperability between different systems and improve the
        efficiency of data exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
        HL7 standards are widely used in healthcare IT systems, including electronic health records (EHRs), health
        information exchanges (HIEs), and other healthcare applications. These standards define the structure, content,
        and format of messages exchanged between healthcare systems, ensuring that data is transmitted accurately and
        consistently.
    </p>

    <p>
        HL7 and its members provide a framework (and related standards) for the exchange, integration, sharing, and
        retrieval of electronic health information. These standards define how information is packaged and communicated
        from one party to another, setting the language, structure and data types required for seamless integration
        between systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        HL7 standards are grouped into families, each focused on a specific aspect of healthcare information management:

    <ul>
        <li>HL7 Version 2.x: The most widely used standard for exchanging healthcare data in the world. It defines the
            structure and content of messages exchanged between healthcare systems.</li>
        <li>HL7 Version 3: A more complex and comprehensive standard that provides a framework for the development of
            domain-specific data exchange models.</li>
        <li>Clinical Document Architecture (CDA): A standard for the exchange of clinical documents, such as discharge
            summaries and progress notes, in a structured format.</li>
        <li>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR): A modern standard for exchanging healthcare data using
            web technologies and APIs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>OSI model</h3>
    <p>
        The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a
        telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose and
        interacts with the adjacent layers to provide a cohesive set of services. The OSI model is not a protocol in
        itself,
        but rather a model that helps guide the development of protocols and standards that enable different systems to
        communicate with each other.

    <p>
        HL7 gets its name from the seventh layer of the OSI model, which is the application layer. The application layer
        provides network services directly to end-user applications. In the context of HL7, the application layer
        represents the interface between healthcare applications and the underlying network infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some common standards developed by HL7 include HL7 Version 2.x, HL7 Version 3, the Clinical Document
        Architecture (CDA), and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). These standards define the structure
        and content of messages exchanged between healthcare systems, ensuring that data is transmitted accurately and
        consistently.
    </p>

    <h2>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</h2>
    <p>
        Introduced as part of HL7 v3, <strong>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</strong> is a standard
        for exchanging healthcare information electronically. FHIR is designed to enable the exchange of healthcare data
        between different systems and applications in a fast, secure, and interoperable manner. FHIR uses modern web
        technologies and APIs to provide a flexible and scalable approach to healthcare data exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a standard for exchanging health information
        electronically. It was developed to fill the need for faster easier ways to exchange health data. It is an
        application programming interface (API) that allows healthcare data to be shared between
        different computer systems, regardless of how it's stored.
    </p>
    <p>
        FHIR uses a modern web-based suite of API technology, including a HTTP-based RESTful protocol, and a choice of
        JSON, XML or RDF for data representation.
