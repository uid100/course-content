    <h2>Data Integration</h2>
    <p>
        In today's healthcare landscape, data integration is critical for delivering efficient and high-quality care.
        With the increasing digitization of healthcare services, integrating data from multiple sources—such as
        electronic health have access to accurate and comprehensive patient information. However, achieving seamless
        data integration is complex, which is why standards like Health Level 7 (HL7) and Fast Healthcare
        Interoperability Resources (FHIR) play an essential role.
    </p>
    <p>
        HL7 and FHIR are widely adopted healthcare data standards that enable the exchange of clinical information
        between different systems. These standards provide a framework for structuring, sharing, and accessing
        healthcare data in a consistent manner. HL7 focuses on the exchange of structured data through standardized
        messaging protocols, while FHIR introduces a more modern, flexible approach using web technologies and APIs,
        making it easier for diverse systems to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the key challenges in data integration is harmonizing information from varied sources, each potentially
        using different formats, terminologies, and structures. This is where data mapping and transformation techniques
        become crucial. These techniques help translate data from one system to another, ensuring that information is
        correctly interpreted and utilized across platforms. Without effective mapping and transformation, the risk of
        data inconsistency, errors, and information gaps increases—potentially jeopardizing patient care.
    </p>
    <p>
        Together, data integration, the use of HL7 and FHIR standards, and advanced mapping techniques enable healthcare
        systems to streamline operations, improve decision-making, and enhance patient outcomes. Their
        interconnectedness ensures that the right information is available to the right people at the right time, which
        is fundamental to the delivery of modern healthcare services.
