        Primary Key
    </h2>
    <p>
        A primary key is a special kind of attribute (or field) in a database that is used to uniquely identify each
        record in a set of data. Think of it as a unique ID that helps you tell one item apart from another, even if
        some of their other details are the same.

    <p>
        For example, in a table of employees, many people might have the same first name, like "John." But the primary
        key could be an "Employee ID" number that is unique for each person, ensuring that no two people share the same
        ID. This way, you can always tell which "John" is which by looking at their ID.

    <p>
        In simple terms, a primary key helps keep things organized and avoids confusion by giving every item its own
        unique label.
