    <h1>Database Schema-Based Constraints</h1>

    <p>
        Constraints are rules that define the structure and integrity of a database schema. They ensure that data
        adheres to certain conditions, preventing inconsistencies and maintaining data quality. There are several types
        of constraints that can be applied to database tables, including domain constraints, key constraints, NULL
        constraints, entity integrity, and referential integrity constraints.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href=" #domain-constraints">Domain Constraints</a> limit what kind of data you can store in a particular
    column.</li>
    <li><a href="#key-constraints">Key Constraints</a> require that every record (row) in a table needs to be unique.
        The primary key is a special column that ensures this.</li>
    <li><a href="#null-constraints">NULL Constraints</a> define whether a column can be left empty or must have a value.
    </li>
    <li><a href="#entity-integrity">Entity Integrity</a> ensures that every row in a table is unique and identifiable.
    </li>
    <li><a href="#referential-integrity-constraints">Referential Integrity Constraints</a> ensures that relationships
        between tables are valid</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. Domain Constraints</h2>
    <p>
        Domain constraints define the permissible values for a given column in a database table. These are the
        restrictions on the type, format, or range of values that can be stored in a column.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Type:</strong> Specifies the type of data (e.g., INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE).</li>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> Restricts values to a specific range (e.g., salary must be between 1000 and 5000).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Format:</strong> Ensures that values adhere to a particular format (e.g., email addresses must
            follow an "abc@domain.com" format).</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Key Constraints</h2>
    <p>
        Key constraints ensure the uniqueness and identification of data within a table.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary Key:</strong> A column or a combination of columns that uniquely identify a record in the
            table. It cannot contain NULL values.</li>
        <li><strong>Unique Key:</strong> Ensures that the values in a column or group of columns are unique across all
            rows, but unlike the primary key, it can allow NULL values.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>3. NULL Constraints</h2>
    <p>
        NULL constraints define whether or not a column can accept NULL values.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>NOT NULL:</strong> Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value; a value must be provided for
            every record.</li>
        <li><strong>NULL:</strong> Allows a column to have NULL values (though this is often implicit unless constrained
            otherwise).</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Entity Integrity</h2>
    <p>
        Entity integrity ensures that each row in a table can be uniquely identified. This is typically enforced by a
        <strong>primary key</strong>, which ensures no two rows can have the same primary key value and that it cannot
        be NULL.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Referential Integrity Constraints</h2>
    <p>
        Referential integrity constraints are rules that ensure consistency between tables. They typically involve
        relationships between primary and foreign keys.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Foreign Key:</strong> A column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key in
            another table. This ensures that a record in one table corresponds to a valid record in the related table.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cascade Delete/Update:</strong> When a record in the parent table is deleted or updated, the related
            records in the child table may also be automatically deleted or updated.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
