        <h1>Normalization - An Example</h1>
        <p>
            Let's revisit the MedStaff.sql data base from a prior module.
        </p>

        <div id="normalization" class="accordion-item">
            <button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#denormalized-info"
                aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="denormalized-info">
                <h3>Denormalized</h3>
            </button>
            <div id="denormalized-info" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" aria-labelledby="denormalized"
                data-bs-parent="#normalization" style="margin:20px;">
                <p>
                    The MedStaff database is a simple example of a denormalized database. The MedStaff table contains
                    information about medical staff, including their ID, name, specialty, and department. The table is
                    denormalized because it contains repeating groups of data, such as the department and specialty
                    columns, which could be separated into their own tables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Denormalized databases can be easier to query and maintain, but they can also lead to data
                    inconsistencies and redundancy. By normalizing the MedStaff database, we can reduce redundancy and
                    improve data integrity.
                </p>
                <pre style="border: solid; margin:auto; width:50%;">
CREATE TABLE MedicalStaff (

                <h3>1NF</h3>
            </button>
            <div id="1NF-info" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" aria-labelledby="1NF"
                data-bs-parent="#normalization" style="margin:20px;">
                <p>
                    The MedStaff database is not in First Normal Form (1NF) because it contains repeating groups of data
                    in the specialty and department columns. To normalize the database, we need to separate these
                    repeating groups into their own tables and establish relationships between them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To transform the MedicalStaff table into First Normal Form (1NF), we need to ensure that each column
                    contains atomic values, meaning each column holds only a single value and does not contain multiple
                    pieces of data. In the provided table, the full_name column contains multiple pieces of information
                    (first name, last name, etc.), so we will split it into separate columns.
                </p>
                <pre style="border: solid; margin:auto; width:50%;">
                    CREATE TABLE MedicalStaff (
                        personnel_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                        first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
                        last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
                        role_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
                        specialty_name VARCHAR(100) NULL,
                        hospital_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
                        show_movie VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
                        location VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
                    );
                </pre>

                <p>
                    The full_name column has been split into first_name and last_name, ensuring that each field contains
                    only a single piece of information, thus adhering to 1NF.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, the table is in First Normal Form because each column contains atomic values, and each row is
                    uniquely identified by the personnel_id.

            <p>
                To normalize the MedicalStaff table into Second Normal Form (2NF), we need to ensure that:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The table is in First Normal Form (1NF).</li>
                <li>There are no partial dependencies, meaning all non-key columns must depend on the entire primary
                    key.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In your current table, the personnel_id is the primary key, but columns like hospital_name, show_movie,
                and
                location do not directly depend on the individual personnel_id. Instead, these columns depend on the
                hospital, meaning that we should separate these into their own table to remove the partial dependencies.
            </p>

            <h3>Step-by-Step Normalization to 2NF</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a new table for hospitals, since information like hospital_name, location, and show_movie
                    depends on
                    the hospital, not the personnel.</li>
                <li>Create a separate table for specialties, as the same specialty may apply to multiple personnel.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Normalized Tables in 2NF:</h3>
            <ol>

            CREATE TABLE MedicalStaff (

                first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
                last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

                hospital_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
                location VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,

                <li>Specialties Table
                    <pre>
            CREATE TABLE Specialties (
                specialty_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                specialty_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
            );
        </pre>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The MedicalStaff table now focuses only on personnel-specific information, with foreign keys
                    referencing the
                    Hospitals and Specialties tables.</li>
                <li>The Hospitals table holds hospital-specific information like the hospital_name, location, and
                    show_movie, which were
                    removed from the MedicalStaff table.</li>
                <li>The Specialties table holds specialty-specific data. The MedicalStaff table now references
                    specialty_id to avoid
                    repeating specialty names across multiple personnel.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>

                By splitting the data this way, the table is now in Second Normal Form (2NF), as all non-key columns in
                the
                MedicalStaff table depend entirely on the primary key (personnel_id) without any partial dependencies.

        <p>
            To normalize the MedicalStaff table into Third Normal Form (3NF), we need to ensure that:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The table is in Second Normal Form (2NF).</li>
            <li>There are no transitive dependencies, meaning all non-key columns depend only on the primary key and not
                on other non-key columns.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Looking at the tables in 2NF, the Hospitals table contains columns that might have a transitive dependency:
            show_movie is dependent on hospital_name, rather than directly on the hospital_id. To normalize to 3NF, we
            need to remove any such dependencies by ensuring that every non-key attribute depends only on the primary
            key.
        </p>
        <h3>Step-by-Step Normalization to 3NF</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the show_movie column from the Hospitals table and create a new table for hospital shows.</li>

            </li>
            <li>Specialties Table <br>
                This is also unchanged.

            );
        </pre>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The MedicalStaff, Hospitals, and Specialties tables remain largely unchanged from 2NF, as they do not
                contain any transitive dependencies.</li>
            <li>The new HospitalShows table removes the transitive dependency from the Hospitals table. Now, the
                show_movie column is linked directly to the hospital_id in a separate table, ensuring that the only
                columns in Hospitals are directly related to the hospital itself (i.e., hospital_name and location).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            With these changes, the schema is now in Third Normal Form (3NF). Every non-key column is fully dependent on
            the primary key and there are no transitive dependencies. This reduces redundancy and improves the database
            structure, ensuring that data is both normalized and efficient to query.
