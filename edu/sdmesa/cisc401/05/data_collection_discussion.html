    <h2>Data Collection Considerations</h2>

    <p>
        In the world of healthcare, data collection is a crucial yet challenging process.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this discussion, choose one of the data collections available at the World Health Organization (WHO)
        website:
        <a href="https://www.who.int/data/collections" target="_blank">WHO Data Collections</a>. Identify the data set you selected and
        explore the data collection process. In your post, address the following points:
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>(10 points)</strong> Briefly describe the data set you selected, its magnitude, and its purpose.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong><strong>(10 points)</strong> Data Collection Process:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Describe the data set and its purpose.</li>
                <li>How is the data collected? (Is it through surveys, hospital records, machine-generated, user input,
                    etc.?)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><strong>(10 points)</strong> Challenges:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>What challenges might this data collection face in terms of mandatory or voluntary reporting?</li>
                <li>What privacy concerns may arise, especially when dealing with sensitive healthcare data?</li>
                <li>Are there participation challenges (e.g., low response rates, inconsistent reporting across
                    regions)?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><strong>(10 points)</strong> Standardization:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Does this data collection involve standardized methods?</li>
                <li>How might reliance on user input or machine-generated data impact the accuracy or reliability of the
                    data? What are the potential errors or concerns with either approach?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Be sure to provide specific examples and details from the data set you selected to support your points.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>(10 points)</strong> In your follow-up replies to two (2) peers, consider how their selected data set is
        different from the one you chose:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            How do their observations impact your thoughts about the data set you looked at?
        </li>
        <li>
            Did they raise any concerns or points that made you rethink aspects of your own data set?
        </li>
    </ol>
