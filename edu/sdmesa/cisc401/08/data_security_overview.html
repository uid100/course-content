    <h1>Data Security in Healthcare</h1>
    <p>
        In this module, we are going to consider the concept of data security and its importance in the context of
        healthcare.
    </p>

    <p>
        Data security in healthcare is crucial for safeguarding sensitive patient information, ensuring the integrity of
        medical records, and maintaining trust between healthcare providers and patients. Given the highly sensitive
        nature of healthcare data, including personal health information (PHI), medical histories, and financial
        details, the healthcare industry has become a prime target for cyberattacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Healthcare systems face various vulnerabilities, including outdated software, insufficient access controls, and
        human error, making them susceptible to threats like data breaches, ransomware attacks, and insider misuse. The
        consequences of such vulnerabilities can be severe, leading to compromised patient privacy, financial loss,
        legal penalties, and even risks to patient safety.
    </p>
    <p>
        To mitigate these risks, healthcare organizations must adopt a range of safeguards, including robust encryption
        protocols, strict access controls, regular employee training, and adherence to regulatory frameworks like HIPAA.
        These measures are essential to protecting patient data and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and
        availability of healthcare information.
