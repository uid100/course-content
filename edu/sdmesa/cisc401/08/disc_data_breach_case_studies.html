    <h2>Discussion Project Prompt: Investigating Data Breaches in Healthcare</h2>

    <hr>

    <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
    <p>
        In recent years, healthcare institutions have become a prime target for cyberattacks due to the sensitivity and
        value of the data they manage. A significant number of healthcare organizations have experienced data breaches,
        resulting in compromised patient information, operational disruptions, and financial loss. This project will
        give you an opportunity to investigate real-world examples of healthcare data breaches, understand how they
        occurred, their consequences, and the measures taken to prevent future incidents.
    </p>

    <h3>Prompt:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Research an Example:</strong>
            <p>
                Identify a specific instance of a data breach in the healthcare industry (e.g., ransomware attacks,
                insider threats, or accidental breaches). This could be a recent case or a well-documented one from the
                past decade.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Analyze the Breach:</strong>
            <p>
                Provide a detailed analysis of the breach by addressing the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How the breach occurred:</strong> What type of attack was involved? Was it a result of
                    phishing, malware, weak security practices, etc.?</li>
                <li><strong>What data was compromised:</strong> What types of data were accessed (e.g., patient records,
                    financial information, PHI)?</li>
                <li><strong>Impact of the breach:</strong> Discuss the consequences of the breach, including the
                    financial cost, reputational damage, legal penalties, and effects on patients.</li>
                <li><strong>Response to the breach:</strong> How did the healthcare institution respond? What measures
                    were taken to contain the breach, notify affected individuals, and prevent future incidents?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Recommendations for Prevention:</strong>
            <p>
                Based on your research, propose 2-3 recommendations or best practices that could have prevented the
                breach or mitigated its effects. You can focus on areas like encryption, access control, employee
                training, or secure system design.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Share and Discuss:</strong>
            <p>
                After completing your research, share your findings with the class in the form of a written report
                (500-700 words). In your submission, include links to reputable sources (news articles, reports,
                official statements, etc.). Be prepared to engage in an in-class or online discussion where you will
                compare your case with others and discuss different prevention strategies.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
