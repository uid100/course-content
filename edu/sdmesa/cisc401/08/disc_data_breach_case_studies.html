    <h2>Discussion: Data Breaches in Healthcare</h2>

    <hr>

    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>
        In recent years, healthcare institutions have become a prime target for cyberattacks due to the sensitivity and
        value of the data they manage. A significant number of healthcare organizations have experienced data breaches,
        resulting in compromised patient information, operational disruptions, and financial loss. This project will
        give you an opportunity to investigate real-world examples of healthcare data breaches, understand how they
        occurred, their consequences, and the measures taken to prevent future incidents.

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Research:</strong>
            <p>
                Identify a specific instance of a data breach in the healthcare industry (e.g., ransomware attacks,
                insider threats, or accidental breaches). This could be a recent case or a well-documented one from the
                past decade.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Analysis:</strong>
            <p>
                Provide a detailed analysis of the breach by addressing the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How the breach occurred:</strong> What type of attack was involved? Was it a result of
                    phishing, malware, weak security practices, etc.?</li>
                <li><strong>What data was compromised:</strong> What types of data were accessed (e.g., patient records,
                    financial information, PHI)?</li>
                <li><strong>Impact of the breach:</strong> Discuss the consequences of the breach, including the
                    financial cost, reputational damage, legal penalties, and effects on patients.</li>
                <li><strong>Response to the breach:</strong> How did the healthcare institution respond? What measures
                    were taken to contain the breach, notify affected individuals, and prevent future incidents?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Share and Discuss:</strong>
            <p>
                Share your findings. In your submission, include links to reputable sources (news articles, reports,
                official statements, etc.). Respond to at least two of your peers' submissions, providing feedback and
                engaging in a discussion about the breach cases. You can compare your case with others and discuss
                different prevention strategies.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This project will enhance your understanding of how healthcare organizations handle data breaches, the
        importance of securing patient information, and the role of regulatory compliance. Be sure to approach this
        assignment with a critical and analytical mindset, and draw connections to the key data security principles
        we've covered in class.
