### **Discussion Project Prompt: Investigating Data Breaches in Healthcare**

---

**Project Overview:**

In recent years, healthcare institutions have become a prime target for cyberattacks due to the sensitivity and value of the data they manage. A significant number of healthcare organizations have experienced data breaches, resulting in compromised patient information, operational disruptions, and financial loss. This project will give you an opportunity to investigate real-world examples of healthcare data breaches, understand how they occurred, their consequences, and the measures taken to prevent future incidents.

---

### **Prompt:**

1. **Research an Example:**  
   Identify a specific instance of a data breach in the healthcare industry (e.g., ransomware attacks, insider threats, or accidental breaches). This could be a recent case or a well-documented one from the past decade.

2. **Analyze the Breach:**  
   Provide a detailed analysis of the breach by addressing the following:
   - **How the breach occurred:** What type of attack was involved? Was it a result of phishing, malware, weak security practices, etc.?
   - **What data was compromised:** What types of data were accessed (e.g., patient records, financial information, PHI)?
   - **Impact of the breach:** Discuss the consequences of the breach, including the financial cost, reputational damage, legal penalties, and effects on patients.
   - **Response to the breach:** How did the healthcare institution respond? What measures were taken to contain the breach, notify affected individuals, and prevent future incidents?

3. **Recommendations for Prevention:**  
   Based on your research, propose 2-3 recommendations or best practices that could have prevented the breach or mitigated its effects. You can focus on areas like encryption, access control, employee training, or secure system design.

4. **Share and Discuss:**  
   After completing your research, share your findings with the class in the form of a written report (500-700 words). In your submission, include links to reputable sources (news articles, reports, official statements, etc.). Be prepared to engage in an in-class or online discussion where you will compare your case with others and discuss different prevention strategies.

|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Case Selection**                | Clear and relevant example of a healthcare data breach, thoroughly researched and well-documented. | Relevant example with good research and documentation, though slightly less detailed. | Selected case is somewhat relevant but lacks depth in research or documentation. | Case is unclear, poorly documented, or irrelevant.                    | 20          |
| **Breach Analysis**               | Comprehensive analysis of how the breach occurred, data compromised, impact, and response. Insightful connections made to course content. | Clear analysis, covering key areas of the breach, but lacking some depth or connections to course concepts. | Basic analysis of the breach with gaps in information or understanding of the case. | Analysis is incomplete or inaccurate, lacking essential details about the breach. | 25          |
| **Recommendations for Prevention**| Well-supported and creative recommendations that show a strong understanding of security practices. Linked to breach analysis. | Good recommendations based on security concepts, though they could be more specific or detailed. | Recommendations are generic or only loosely connected to the case analysis. | Recommendations are unclear, unsupported, or not connected to the breach. | 20          |
| **Discussion and Engagement**     | Actively engages in the class discussion, contributes original thoughts, and responds thoughtfully to peers. | Engages in discussion, shares findings, and responds to peers with relevant input. | Some engagement in discussion, but contributions are minimal or superficial. | Does not engage or only minimally participates in discussion.          | 15          |
| **Writing Quality and Clarity**   | Clear, concise, and well-organized report with no grammatical or spelling errors. Sources are cited properly. | Report is mostly clear and well-organized, with few minor grammatical or spelling issues. Proper source citation. | Report has some organizational or grammatical issues, but meaning is generally clear. Source citation is inconsistent. | Report is disorganized or unclear, with many grammatical errors. Little to no proper source citation. | 10          |
| **Sources and Research**          | Uses multiple, reputable sources, including news reports, official documents, and security analyses. All sources are properly cited. | Uses several reputable sources but may miss some key references. Citations are generally correct. | Uses limited sources or relies on less reputable references. Citations may be inconsistent or incomplete. | Relies on poor-quality sources or lacks adequate research. No or improper citations. | 10          |
| **Total Points**                  | **100**                                        |                                                 |                                                 |                                                 |             |
