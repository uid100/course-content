        <h3>Encryption and Access Control</h3>
        <p>Key Concepts</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Encryption
                <p style="width:80%; margin:10px auto; border: black solid 1px">
                    The process of converting plaintext data into a scrambled format (ciphertext) using algorithms to
                    prevent unauthorized access.</p>
                <ul>
                    Types of encryption
                    <li>Symmetric encryption (private key)</li>
                    <li>Asymmetric encryption (private key/public key)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Vulernabilities
                <ul>
                    <li>Data storage
                        <p style="width:80%; margin:10px auto; border: black solid 1px">
                            Involves storing information in a format that can be accessed and used. Data can be stored
                            in databases, which structure data by similarity or group affiliation, or in electronic
                            records, which allow data to be accessed from multiple locations.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Data processing
                        <p style="width:80%; margin:10px auto; border: black solid 1px">
                            Involves manipulating data to produce information. Data processing can be done manually or
                            electronically and involves a range of operations performed on data, including collection,
                            recording, organization, and storage.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data transmission
                        <p style="width:80%; margin:10px auto; border: black solid 1px">
                            Involves transferring data between devices or systems, usually over a network. Data
                            transmission requires a sender, receiver, message, medium, and protocol. The medium is the
                            physical path used to transmit data, such as a cable or wireless connection. The protocol is
                            a set of rules that govern the format, timing, and sequencing of the data transmission..</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Access Control Mechanisms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Restricting data access based on roles (e.g., doctors, nurses,
                admins).</li>
            <li>The Principle of Least Privilege: only granting users the minimum level of access needed for their role.
            </li>
            <li>Multifactor Authentication (MFA): adding an extra layer of security.</li>
            <li>Auditing and monitoring access logs to identify potential security threats.</li>
        </ul>

        <summary>Secure Database Design Principles</summary>

        <h3>Core Principles of Secure Database Design</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Separation of Duties: Ensuring different roles within a healthcare system have appropriate access to
                only what
                they need.</li>
            <li>Data Minimization: Only collect and store data that is necessary for healthcare operations.</li>
            <li>Normalization: Reducing redundancy to minimize the attack surface for breaches.</li>
            <li>Database Encryption: Encrypting sensitive fields in the database (e.g., SSN, medical records).</li>
            <li>Audit Logging: Maintaining detailed logs of data access and modifications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Security Best Practices for Healthcare Databases</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Input Validation: Protecting against SQL Injection and other attacks.</li>
            <li>Stored Procedures: Using stored procedures to reduce risk.</li>
            <li>Access Controls at the Database Level: Applying fine-grained controls to restrict who can view or edit
                specific data fields.</li>
        </ul>
