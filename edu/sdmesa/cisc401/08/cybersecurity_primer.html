    <h2>Data Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <p>
        A <strong>data vulnerability</strong> in cybersecurity is a weakness in a system, software, or
        network that can be exploited by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vulnerabilities can arise from flaws in the system design, software bugs, or human error. When
        exploited, vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and theft of information.

    <h2>Common exploit methods</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SQL Injection</strong>
            <p style="width: 80%; border: black 1px">
                A method where attackers manipulate SQL queries to execute unauthorized
                database commands.
            </p>
            <details>
                <summary>Explanation</summary>
                <p>
                    SQL injection attacks occur when attackers insert malicious SQL code into input fields
                    on a website to manipulate the database queries. This allows them to access, modify, or
                    delete data in the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SQL Injection is a type of cyberattack where an attacker manipulates a web application's SQL
                    queries by injecting malicious SQL code into input fields, such as login forms, search bars, or
                    URL parameters. By exploiting vulnerabilities in how SQL queries are handled, attackers can gain
                    unauthorized access to databases, manipulate data, or even destroy information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SQL Injection occurs when user input is incorrectly handled or not properly sanitized before
                    being included in a SQL query. If the application trusts this input, the malicious SQL code can
                    execute unintended commands, such as retrieving confidential data, altering records, or
                    bypassing authentication.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    Common SQL Injection Attack Goals:
                    <li>Extract sensitive data (e.g., usernames, passwords, personal information)</li>
                    <li>Bypass authentication (e.g., login without proper credentials)</li>
                    <li>Modify or delete data (e.g., updating or deleting records)</li>
                    <li>Execute administrative operations (e.g., creating new user accounts)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Simple Example of SQL Injection</h3>
                <p>
                    Imagine a login form where a user provides a username and password. A typical SQL query to check
                    login credentials might look like this:
                    ```sql
                    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user' AND password = 'password';
                    ```
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this case, the username and password are taken from the user input and inserted into the SQL
                    query.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, consider what happens if the input fields are not properly validated or sanitized. An
                    attacker can input malicious code instead of a valid username or password. For example, if the
                    attacker enters the following into the username field:
                    ```sql
                    ' OR '1' = '1
                    ```
                </p>
                <p>
                    The resulting query becomes:
                    ```sql
                    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1' = '1' AND password = '';
                    ```
                </p>
                <p>
                    This query does something very different than intended. The condition OR '1' = '1' will always
                    evaluate as true, meaning that the query returns all users from the users table and grants the
                    attacker access without needing a valid password.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a simple example of SQL injection, but it illustrates how a small oversight in input
                    validation can lead to a significant security vulnerability.

        <li><strong>Buffer Overflows</strong>
            <p style="width: 80%; border: black 1px">
                A method where attackers exploit the overflow of memory buffers to
                execute malicious code.
            </p>
            <details>
                <summary>Explanation</summary>
                <p>
                    Buffer overflows occur when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, causing the
                    excess data to overflow into adjacent memory locations. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability
                    to inject and execute malicious code, leading to system crashes, unauthorized access, or
                    arbitrary code execution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Buffer overflows are a common vulnerability in software applications, especially those written
                    in
                    low-level languages like C and C++. By carefully crafting input data to exceed the buffer's
                    capacity, attackers can overwrite critical memory addresses, manipulate program flow, and
                    compromise the system's security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Buffer overflows can have serious consequences, such as allowing attackers to gain control of a
                    system, escalate privileges, or launch denial-of-service attacks. To prevent buffer overflow
                    vulnerabilities, developers should implement secure coding practices, input validation, and
                    memory protection mechanisms.

        <li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong>
            <p style="width: 80%; border: black 1px">
                A method where attackers inject malicious scripts into
                websites that other users access.
            </p>
            <details>
                <summary>Explanation</summary>
                <p>
                    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of web vulnerability where attackers inject malicious
                    scripts
                    into web pages viewed by other users. By exploiting XSS vulnerabilities, attackers can steal
                    sensitive information, hijack user sessions, deface websites, or launch phishing attacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    XSS attacks occur when web applications fail to properly validate and sanitize user input before
                    displaying it to other users. Attackers can inject scripts, such as JavaScript, into input
                    fields
                    or URLs, which are then executed by unsuspecting users' browsers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several types of XSS attacks, including reflected XSS, stored XSS, and DOM-based XSS.
                    Each type targets different vulnerabilities in web applications and can have varying impacts on
                    users and systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To prevent XSS attacks, developers should implement input validation, output encoding, and
                    security headers in their web applications. Users can protect themselves by being cautious of
                    suspicious links, enabling browser security features, and using content security policies.

        <li><strong>Open-Source Exploit Kits</strong>
            <p style="width: 80%; border: black 1px">
                Tools that cybercriminals use to automate the discovery of
                known vulnerabilities in web applications.
            </p>
            <details>
                <summary>Explanation</summary>
                <p>
                    Open-source exploit kits are software tools used by cybercriminals to automate the discovery and
                    exploitation of known vulnerabilities in web applications. These kits contain pre-built
                    exploits, payloads, and attack scripts that can be used to compromise systems and steal
                    sensitive
                    data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Exploit kits are designed to target common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, XSS, and
                    buffer overflows, in popular web applications and frameworks. By scanning the internet for
                    vulnerable sites and launching automated attacks, cybercriminals can infect users with malware,
                    steal credentials, or take control of compromised systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some famous exploit kits include Metasploit, Exploit Pack, and Blackhole. These kits have been
                    responsible for numerous high-profile data breaches and cyberattacks, highlighting the
                    importance
                    of securing web applications against known vulnerabilities.
