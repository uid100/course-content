    <h1>Relational Database</h1>
    <p>A <strong>relational database</strong> is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that
        are related to one another. It is based on the relational model, which organizes data into one or more tables
        (or "relations") of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. Each table represents a different
        type of entity, such as a person, a product, or an order, and relationships between tables are established
        through foreign keys.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

    <hr />
    <h3>Set Theory</h3>
    <p>Relational databases are grounded in set theory, which is the mathematical study of sets, or collections of
        distinct objects. In the context of databases, tables can be viewed as sets of rows (or tuples). Operations like
        selection, projection, and join, which are fundamental to relational databases, are derived from operations on
        sets in set theory.</p>

    <hr />
    <h3>Predicate Logic</h3>
    <p>Predicate logic (or first-order logic) is used to express the conditions that data must satisfy. In a relational
        database, queries often use predicates to filter data based on certain conditions. For example, a SQL
        <code>WHERE</code> clause can be seen as applying a logical predicate to select specific rows from a table.
    </p>

    <hr />
    <h3>Values</h3>
    <p>In a relational database, a value is a single piece of data. It corresponds to a cell in a table. For example, in
        a table representing employees, the value in the "Name" column for a specific employee might be "John Doe."</p>

    <hr />
    <h3>Tuples</h3>
    <p>A tuple is a finite ordered list of elements. In the context of a relational database, a tuple is a single row
        within a table, representing a specific entity or instance of that table’s entity type. For instance, a row in
        an "Employees" table is a tuple that might consist of values such as an employee ID, name, and job title.</p>

    <hr />
    <h3>Relations</h3>
    <p>A relation in a relational database is a set of tuples. Each relation is represented as a table. The relation’s
        schema defines the structure of the table, including the columns (attributes) and the types of values they can
        hold. The relational model allows operations like selecting, joining, and aggregating data from one or more
        relations.</p>

    <hr />
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Consider a relational database for a hospital:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Relation (Table)</strong>: <code>Personnel</code></li>
        <li><strong>Schema</strong>: <code>Personnel(ID, Name, Title, RoleID)</code></li>
        <li><strong>Tuples (Rows)</strong>: Each row represents an employee with specific values for ID, Name, Title,
            and RoleID.</li>
        <li><strong>Values</strong>: For a specific employee, values might be <code>ID=123</code>,
            <code>Name='John Doe'</code>, <code>Title='Dr.'</code>, <code>RoleID=1</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>By using set theory, you can perform operations like selecting all doctors, and by using predicate logic, you can
        apply conditions like "where Title is 'Dr.'". These operations help manage and retrieve data in a relational
        database efficiently.</p>
