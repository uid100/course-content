    <h1>Client-Server Architecture: A Brief Overview</h1>
    <p>
        In the realm of computing, the client-server architecture plays a pivotal role. Imagine placing a food delivery
        order via an app: your smartphone (the client) interacts with the restaurant's computer (the server). This
        interaction exemplifies the essence of client-server architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what exactly is client-server architecture? It's a system where clients (devices like your smartphone or
        computer) request services or resources from servers (systems that provide those services). These servers handle
        requests and respond with the necessary data, creating dynamic and effective interactions.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Components of Client-Server Model:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Workstations (Client Computers):</strong> These devices initiate requests and run operating systems
            like Windows, connecting to central servers via networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Servers:</strong> These systems house databases, handle data storage, query processing, and
            transaction management.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The client-server model enables seamless resource sharing and communication across networks, including the
        Internet. It's the backbone of various online services, from websites to email servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the context of databases, the client-server model is particularly relevant. Modern database architectures
        often adopt this model, dividing functions between client-side and server-side components. For instance, the
        database server hosts the DBMS (Database Management System) and the actual database, managing data storage and
        queries.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether you're building web applications, managing data, or handling transactions, understanding client-server
        architecture is essential. ðŸš€
