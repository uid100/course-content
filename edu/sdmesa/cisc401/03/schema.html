    <h1>What is a Schema?</h1>
    <p>A <strong>schema</strong> in the context of databases is a blueprint or structure that defines the organization
        of data within a database. It specifies how data is stored, the types of data that can be held, the
        relationships between different data entities, and the rules for how the data can be manipulated.</p>

    <h2>Key Aspects of a Schema</h2>

    <h3>Tables</h3>
    <p>A schema defines the tables within a database. Each table represents a specific entity (e.g., employees,
        products) and consists of columns and rows.</p>

    <h3>Columns (Attributes)</h3>
    <p>Within each table, a schema defines the columns, also known as attributes. Each column has a name and a data
        type, which specifies the kind of data that can be stored in that column (e.g., integer, string, date).</p>

    <h3>Relationships</h3>
    <p>A schema outlines the relationships between tables. For example, it may define foreign keys that link rows in one
        table to rows in another table, establishing a relationship between those entities (e.g., an order linked to a
        customer).</p>

    <h3>Constraints</h3>
    <p>A schema includes rules and constraints that ensure data integrity. Common constraints include primary keys,
        which uniquely identify each row in a table, and foreign keys, which enforce referential integrity between
        tables.</p>

    <h3>Indexes</h3>
    <p>The schema may also define indexes, which are structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations by
        providing quick access to rows in a table.</p>

    <h3>Views</h3>
    <p>A schema can include views, which are virtual tables created by querying data from one or more tables. Views do
        not store data themselves but provide a way to present data in a specific format or subset.</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Consider a database schema for a hospital:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tables</strong>: <code>Patients</code>, <code>Doctors</code>, <code>Appointments</code></li>
        <li><strong>Columns</strong>:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><code>Patients</code>: <code>PatientID</code>, <code>Name</code>, <code>DateOfBirth</code>,
                <code>Address</code></li>
            <li><code>Doctors</code>: <code>DoctorID</code>, <code>Name</code>, <code>Specialty</code></li>
            <li><code>Appointments</code>: <code>AppointmentID</code>, <code>PatientID</code>, <code>DoctorID</code>,
                <code>AppointmentDate</code></li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Relationships</strong>: The <code>Appointments</code> table has foreign keys <code>PatientID</code>
            and <code>DoctorID</code> that link to the <code>Patients</code> and <code>Doctors</code> tables,
            respectively.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The schema serves as the framework that defines how all these components fit together to manage the hospitalâ€™s
        data effectively.</p>
