        <h2>Healthcare Information Design</h2>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
            Consider any aspect of the healthcare industry, from patient care, medical billing, facilities
            management, compliance, or research. The data generated and managed in healthcare is vast, complex, and
            critical to the delivery of quality care. Designing databases to manage this data is a crucial aspect of
            healthcare information systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            As healthcare professionals, understanding how data is organized, stored, and managed in a healthcare
            database is crucial. This discussion will help you identify key data entities, their associated fields and
            attributes, and the relationships between them that are essential for effective healthcare information
            management.
        </p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <h4>Part 1. Identify Key Entities, Attributes and Relationships (35 pts)</h4>
        <p>
            In the context of a database, an <strong>entity</strong> is an object, concept, or thing in the real
            world that can be distinctly identified and stored as a record in a database. Entities are typically
            represented by tables in a relational database, where each row in the table corresponds to a specific
            instance of the entity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider any aspect of healthcare delivery, such as patient care, treatment management, billing, and
            public health reporting. Identify at least five entities (e.g., Patient, Doctor, Appointment,
            Medication, Insurance, LabTest) that would be crucial to managing healthcare information in a database.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each entity, define the key <strong>attributes</strong> or fields that are essential for
            representing and managing the data associated with that entity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Attributes are the specific pieces of information that describe or characterize an entity. For example,
            the Patient entity might have attributes such as Patient ID, Name, Date of Birth, primary care provider.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, identify and describe the <strong>relationships</strong> between these entities. Relationships
            define how the entities are connected or related to each other in the database. For example, a Patient
            entity may have a relationship with an Appointment entity, indicating that a patient can have multiple
            appointments. The Appointment entity may have a relationship with a Doctor entity, indicating that a
            doctor can have multiple appointments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Format your response as a list or table, clearly identifying the entities, their attributes and data
            types, and the relationships between them.
        </p>
        <h4>Part 2. Collaboration (15 pts)</h4>
        <p>
            Review the responses of at least <strong>three of your peers</strong>. Provide constructive feedback on
            their entity identification, attribute definition, and relationship description. Offer suggestions for
            improvement or additional insights that could enhance their database design, or where any of your
            entities or attributes might be related to theirs.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>
            Here is an example of 4 non-healthcare-related entities, attributes, and relationships to help you get
            started:
