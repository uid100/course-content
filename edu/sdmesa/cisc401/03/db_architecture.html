        <h1>Database Architecture: </h1>
        <p>
            Database architecture refers to the design and structure of a database system. It includes the overall
            layout
            of the database, the relationships between its components, and the principles that govern its operation.

                    <p>
                        A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a software system that provides access to a
                        relational database. It was conceptualized by Edgar F. Codd in 1970, based on set theory and
                        first-order predicate logic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Set theory</strong> is the mathematical study of sets, or collections of distinct
                        objects.
                        In the context of databases, tables can be viewed as sets of rows (or tuples).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Predicate logic</strong> (or first-order logic) is used to express the conditions that
                        data
                        must satisfy. Predicate logic is most easily seen in the WHERE clause of a SQL query, where
                        conditions are applied to filter data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An RDBMS such as SQL Server or MySQL is a database management system that is based on the
                        relational
                        model, which is based on set theory and predicate logic. The relational model organizes data
                        into
                        tables of rows and columns, with a unique key identifying each row. This model is widely used in
                        modern database systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The relational model is based on the concept of relations, which are sets of tuples. Each tuple
                        represents a
                        single row in a table, with each column in the table representing a different attribute. The
                        relational
                        model
                        allows for complex queries and operations on the data, such as joining tables together or
                        filtering
                        rows
                        based
                        on certain criteria.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The database engine of an RDBMS is responsible for managing the data stored in the database. It
                        handles
                        the
                        heavy lifting of storing, retrieving, and updating data, as well as enforcing constraints and
                        ensuring
                        data
                        integrity. It is a highly efficient and reliable system that shields the user from the
                        complexities
                        of
                        data
                        storage and retrieval.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we interact with a database, we typically use a database client, such as a command-line
                        interface
                        or a
                        graphical user interface. This client communicates with the database engine to send queries and
                        receive
                        results.

                    <p>
                        In the realm of computing, the client-server architecture plays a pivotal role. Imagine placing
                        a
                        food
                        delivery order via an app: your smartphone (the client) interacts with the restaurant's computer
                        (the
                        server). This interaction exemplifies the essence of client-server architecture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, what exactly is client-server architecture? It's a system where clients (devices like your
                        smartphone or
                        computer) request services or resources from servers (systems that provide those services).
                        These
                        servers
                        handle requests and respond with the necessary data, creating dynamic and effective
                        interactions.

                        <h4 style="font-style: italic;">What is a Server?</h4>
                        <p>A <strong>server</strong> is any <em>service</em> or entity which will deliver a predictable
                            response
                            to
                            a
                            well-formed request</p>
                    </div> <!-- #server-definition -->

                    <h2>Components of Client-Server Model:</h2>
                    <p>
                        The client-server model enables seamless resource sharing and communication across networks,
                        including
                        the
                        Internet. It's the backbone of various online services, from websites to email servers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the context of databases, the client-server model is particularly relevant. Modern database
                        architectures
                        often adopt this model, dividing functions between client-side and server-side components. For
                        instance,
                        the
                        database server hosts the DBMS (Database Management System) and the actual database, managing
                        data
                        storage
                        and
                        queries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you're building web applications, managing data, or handling transactions, understanding
                        client-server architecture is essential.

                    <h3>Understanding Entities in a Database</h3>

                    <p>In the context of a database, an <strong>entity</strong> is an object, concept, or thing in the
                        real world that can be distinctly identified and stored as a record in a database. Entities are
                        typically represented by tables in a relational database, where each row in the table
                        corresponds to a specific instance of the entity.</p>

                    <h4>Key Characteristics of an Entity:</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Distinct Identity</strong>: Each entity must have a distinct identity, allowing it
                            to
                            be uniquely identified.</li>
                        <li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Entities have attributes, which are properties or
                            characteristics
                            of the entity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Instance</strong>: An instance of an entity is a specific, individual example of
                            that entity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Relationships</strong>: Entities often have relationships with other entities,
                            defining how they are connected.</li>

                    </ul>


                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    <p>Consider a database for an e-commerce platform:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Entity</strong>: <code>Product</code>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Attributes</strong>: <code>ProductID</code>, <code>Name</code>,
                                    <code>Description</code>, <code>Price</code>, <code>StockQuantity</code>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Instance</strong>: A specific product in the database, such as a laptop with
                                    <code>ProductID=101</code>, <code>Name='Laptop'</code>,
                                    <code>Description='15-inch display, 8GB RAM'</code>, <code>Price=799.99</code>,
                                    <code>StockQuantity=25</code>.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Entity</strong>: <code>Customer</code>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Attributes</strong>: <code>CustomerID</code>, <code>Name</code>,
                                    <code>Email</code>, <code>PhoneNumber</code>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Instance</strong>: A specific customer in the database, such as
                                    <code>CustomerID=1</code>, <code>Name='Jane Doe'</code>,
                                    <code>Email='jane.doe@example.com'</code>, <code>PhoneNumber='555-1234'</code>.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In this context, "Product" and "Customer" are entities because they represent objects in the real
                        world that the database needs to track, each with their own set of attributes and relationships
                        to other entities.</p>
