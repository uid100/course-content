    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Since we don't have the opportunity to go around the classroom and have people introduce themselves, we're
            going to do an online introduction and share a little bit about ourselves.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>(2 pts) Add your picture to your Canvas profile. From the Canvas main menu (typically on the upper left side
            of your screen), select Account and go to Settings and upload a picture. <a class="inline_disabled"
                href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-add-a-profile-picture-in-my-user-account-as-a-student/ta-p/518"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Canvas Student Guide</a></li>
        <li>(10 pts) Click reply below, and add a post introducing yourself to the class. Share at least one or two good
            paragraphs so others in the class can find some things in common with you. Ideas might include: what you
            currently do, your major, why you are taking this class, what you would like to do after you finish your
            degree, hobbies, special interests, where you're originally from, where you live (general area), family,
            etc. You can upload pictures if you want to.
            <div class="ic-flash-warning"><em><strong>(THIS PART MUST BE COMPLETE BY THURSDAY (11:59PM) </strong> so
                    that others can reply.)</em></div>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>(8 pts) As part of your introduction, find and share 2 things you have in common with person at least two
            other people in the discussion. To respond to my post or somebody else's post on this thread, click inside
            the Reply box, enter your introduction or response and click the Post Reply button.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Posts and replies should be thoughtful and respectful.</p>
    <p>To get us started, I'll go first.</p>
