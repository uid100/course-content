            A shared goal across the California Community Colleges is to provide students with affordable
            access to high-quality education. To help achieve this goal, the California Community Colleges
            have adopted the use of zero textbook cost (ZTC) course sections.

        <p>
            The materials in this course have been selected, first for their educational value and relevance,
            and second to be consistent with that goal. The materials are available to you at no cost.
