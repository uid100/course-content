    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Yes, it's another one of those "tell us about you" assignments.</strong><br />
            Since we don't have the opportunity to go around the classroom and have people introduce themselves, we're
            going to do an online introduction and share a little bit about ourselves.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(but wait, there's more!)</strong><br />
            Keep reading.

                Add a picture to your Canvas profile. From the Canvas main menu (typically on the upper left side
                of your screen), select Account and go to Settings and upload a picture.

            <li> 10 points <strong>About Me.</strong><br />
                Click reply below, and add a post introducing yourself to the class. Share at least one or two good
                paragraphs so others in the class can find some things in common with you. Ideas might include: what you
                currently do, future plans, hobbies, special interests, where you're originally from, where you live
                (general area), family, etc. Uploading pictures is encouraged! Make a collage.<br />
                I know that this is a relatively small major, and there's a good chance that many of you already know
                each
                other.

            <li> 15 points <strong>Health Information Management</strong><br />
                How would you explain Health Information Management to others-- the discipline? --the major?<br />
                What about it made you interested? How has your understanding of the discipline changed since you began
                down
                the path?
