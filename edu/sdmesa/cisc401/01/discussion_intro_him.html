    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Yes, it's another one of those "tell us about you" assignments.</strong><br />
            Since we don't have the opportunity to go around the classroom and have people introduce themselves, we're
            going to do an online introduction and share a little bit about ourselves.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>(but wait, there's more!)</strong><br />
            Keep reading.

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> 5 points <strong>Picture</strong><br />
            Add a picture to your Canvas profile. From the Canvas main menu (typically on the upper left side
            of your screen), select Account and go to Settings and upload a picture.

        </li>
        <li> 10 points <strong>About Me.</strong><br />
            Click reply below, and add a post introducing yourself to the class. Share at least one or two good
            paragraphs so others in the class can find some things in common with you. Ideas might include: what you
            currently do, future plans, hobbies, special interests, where you're originally from, where you live
            (general area), family, etc. Uploading pictures is encouraged! Make a collage.<br />
            I know that this is a relatively small major, and there's a good chance that many of you already know each
            other.
        </li>
        <li> 15 points <strong>Health Information Management</strong><br />
            How would you explain Health Information Management to others-- the discipline? --the major?<br />
            What about it made you interested? How has your understanding of the discipline changed since you began down
            the path?
        </li>
        <div class="ic-flash-warning"><em><strong>(YOUR INITIAL POST MUST BE COMPLETE BY THURSDAY (11:59PM) </strong>
                so that others can reply.)</em></div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li> 20 points <strong>Discussion</strong><br />
            As part of your introduction, find and share something you have in common or with another person outside of
            your classes or something that you didn't know.<br />
            Reply to at least 2 other posts (10 points each). You can reply to more for a maximum of 20 points.<br />
