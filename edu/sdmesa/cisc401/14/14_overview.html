    <h1>Data Mining in Healthcare and SQL Relational Database Review</h1>
    <p>
        In today's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, the integration of data mining techniques and robust database
        management systems is crucial for enhancing patient care, optimizing operational efficiency, and driving medical
        research. Data mining in healthcare involves extracting meaningful patterns and insights from vast datasets,
        enabling healthcare providers to make informed decisions, predict patient outcomes, and identify trends in
        disease progression and treatment efficacy.

    <p>
        To effectively manage and analyze this data, SQL relational databases play a pivotal role. These databases
        provide a structured framework for storing, retrieving, and manipulating healthcare data, ensuring data
        integrity, security, and accessibility. In this comprehensive review exercise, we will delve into the principles
        of data mining in healthcare, explore various data mining techniques, and conduct a thorough examination of SQL
        relational databases. By the end of this discussion, participants will gain a deeper understanding of how these
        technologies can be leveraged to improve healthcare outcomes and streamline operations.
