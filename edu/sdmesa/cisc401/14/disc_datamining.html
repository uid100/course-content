    <h1>Data Mining in Healthcare</h1>
    <p>
        Research and investigate the application of data mining in healthcare, focusing on tools, techniques, and
        real-world examples.
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Research Data Mining in Healthcare
            <ul>
                <li>Define data mining and its importance in the healthcare sector.</li>
                <li>Identify key benefits and challenges associated with data mining in healthcare.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Explore Tools and Techniques
            <ul>
                <li>Investigate various data mining tools and techniques used in healthcare. Consider methods such as
                    decision tree
                    analysis, clustering, and association rule mining.
                </li>
                <li>Consider how these tools and techniques help in analyzing healthcare data to improve patient
                    outcomes,
                    reduce costs,
                    and enhance operational efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Find Real-World Examples
            <ul>
                <li>Search for examples of data mining applications in healthcare on YouTube. Here are a few videos to
                    get you started. You are encouraged to find and share others.
