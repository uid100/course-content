write instructions for a student database exercise:
1. Write a script to: create a new database with the tables described.
- name the database: 'EHR_DB_[StudentName]'
(hint: connect to your local SQL Server, open a new query in the master database and use the CREATE and USE commands.)
- create the tables from the provided table diagram. Be sure the data types, and foreign key constraints are correct. Use IDENTITY(1,1) for your tables. read more about it here (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-turn-identity_insert-on-and-off-using-sql-server/)
2. Write a second script to add seed data to the tables. There should be at least 20 new records in each table.

Both the create and insert scripts should run without user intervention. You can use the RESET script in the "Student Resources"
module to reset and erase your database while you are testing your scripts.
