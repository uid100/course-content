    <h2>Data Mining</h2>
    <p>
        Data mining is the process of extracting valuable patterns, insights, and relationships from large sets of data
        using statistical, mathematical, and machine-learning techniques. It involves identifying hidden patterns,
        trends, or correlations in data that might not be immediately apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
        By harnessing data mining, healthcare systems can make data-driven decisions that lead to improved patient
        outcomes and streamlined operations.
    </p>
    <h3>Key techniques</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Classification: Categorizing data into predefined groups.</li>
        <li>Clustering: Grouping data points based on similarities.</li>
        <li>Association Rules: Finding relationships between variables in datasets (e.g., market basket analysis).</li>
        <li>Prediction: Using historical data to forecast future events.</li>
        <li>Outlier Detection: Identifying anomalies or deviations in data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Healthcare Applications for Data Mining</h2>
    <p>
        In healthcare, data mining plays a vital role by analyzing vast amounts of patient records, medical histories,
        clinical trial data, and operational metrics to improve outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance patient care.
