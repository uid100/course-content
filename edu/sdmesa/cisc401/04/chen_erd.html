    <h1>Chen ERD</h1>
    <p>A <strong>Chen ERD</strong> refers to an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) style that follows the methodology
        proposed by Peter Chen in 1976. It is one of the earliest and most widely used models for ERDs. Chen's ERD
        notation is used to visually represent the relationships between data entities in a database.</p>

    <h2>Key Elements in Chen's ERD:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Entities</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Represented as rectangles.</li>
                <li>These are objects or things in the system that have a distinct existence (e.g., <em>Person</em>,
                    <em>Department</em>).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Attributes</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Represented as ovals and connected to their entity with lines.</li>
                <li>They describe properties or characteristics of an entity (e.g., <em>Name</em>, <em>Age</em>,
                    <em>Salary</em>).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Relationships</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Represented as diamonds.</li>
                <li>Describe how two or more entities are related (e.g., <em>Works in</em>, <em>Manages</em>).</li>
                <li>Can show cardinality (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Primary Key</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>The unique identifier for an entity, often underlined in the entity's attribute list.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cardinality</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Expressed as symbols near the entities (e.g., "1" for one-to-one, "M" for many).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p>In a simple Chen ERD, if you have an entity <strong>Doctor</strong> related to another entity
        <strong>Hospital</strong> through a relationship <strong>Works At</strong>, it would look like this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Doctor</strong> (Entity) ⟶ <strong>Works At</strong> (Relationship) ⟶ <strong>Hospital</strong>
            (Entity)</li>
        <li>Attributes like <em>DoctorID</em>, <em>DoctorName</em>, etc., are represented as ovals around the
            <strong>Doctor</strong> entity. Similarly, <em>HospitalName</em>, <em>Location</em>, etc., would be
            attributes of <strong>Hospital</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Chen’s ERD notation is particularly detailed and often used in academic contexts due to its ability to clearly
        express complex relationships.</p>
