        Data modeling is the process of creating a data model. It involves identifying and defining the entities,
        attributes, and relationships in a system, and designing how data will be structured, stored, and accessed.

        <p>
            The process typically includes three stages:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conceptual Data Model: Focuses on high-level design, representing key entities and relationships without
                worrying about technical details.</li>
            <li>Logical Data Model: Adds more detail, including attributes and keys, without getting into the physical
                storage implementation.</li>
            <li>Physical Data Model: Defines how the data will be physically stored in the database (tables, indexes,
                partitions, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
        In SQL Server and other relational databases, data modeling helps define the tables, columns, relationships
        (primary and foreign keys), and constraints (e.g., uniqueness, not null).
    </p>

    </p>

    <h1>Data Models</h1>
    <p>
        A data model defines the structure and organization of data within a system.
        It provides a blueprint for how data is stored, organized, and accessed in a
        database. A data model often includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Entities (e.g., People, Products, Orders)</li>
        <li>Attributes (e.g., Name, Price, Date)</li>
        <li>Relationships between entities (e.g., a customer places an order)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Data Models</h2>

    <p>
        There are several types of data models, each with its own way of organizing and
        representing data:
    </p>

    <h3>Hierarchical Model</h3>
    <p>
        Organizes data in a tree-like structure, with parent-child relationships.
        Each parent can have multiple children, but each child has only one parent.
        This model is often used in file systems and XML databases.
    </p>
    <h3>Network Model</h3>
    <p>
        More flexible than the hierarchical model, allowing many-to-many relationships
        between entities. It uses pointers to represent relationships, making it more
        complex but also more powerful.
    </p>
    <h3>Relational Model</h3>
    <p>
        Organizes data into tables (relations) with rows and columns. It is the basis
        for SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. Relationships are
        established through keys (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys).
    </p>
    <h3>Object-Oriented Model</h3>
    <p>
        Stores data as objects, similar to object-oriented programming. Objects
        encapsulate data and behavior, and relationships are represented through
        inheritance and composition.
    </p>
    <h3>Document Model</h3>
    <p>
        Used in NoSQL databases like MongoDB, where data is stored in documents
        (often in JSON-like formats). Each document contains key-value pairs and
        can be nested to represent complex structures.
