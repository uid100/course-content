    <h1>Data Design</h1>
    <p>
        Data design is important in database architecture because it helps ensure that databases are functional,
        reliable, and secure. A well-designed database can:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improve data quality</li>
        <li>Enhance performance</li>
        <li>Enable data analysis</li>
        <li>Make it easier to access and manipulate data</li>
        <li>Make it easier for developers to understand the database</li>
        <li>Help facilitate data exchange</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In contrast poor database design can lead to a database that is obsolete, expensive, and difficult to use.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Models</h2>
    <p>
        Data modeling is the process of creating a data model. It involves identifying and defining the entities,
        attributes, and relationships in a system, and designing how data will be structured, stored, and accessed.
    </p>

    <h3>Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)</h3>
    <p>
        An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the entities, attributes, and relationships
        in a database. It helps in understanding the structure of the database and how different entities are related to
        each other. It is a common artifact which is useful for both database designers and developers to visualize the
        database schema and design.
    </p>
