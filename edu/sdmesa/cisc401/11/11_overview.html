    <h2>Introduction to WHO and Health Data Trend Analysis</h2>

    <p>The <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> is a specialized agency of the United Nations dedicated
        to global public health. WHO's mission is to promote health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable
        by addressing health emergencies, advancing health equity, and expanding access to universal health
        coverage.</p>

    <p>In the context of healthcare database management, WHO offers extensive health-related data through its
        <strong>Global Health Observatory (GHO)</strong>, providing insights on health indicators, disease
        prevalence, mortality rates, and health system performance. This data is vital for trend analysis,
        healthcare planning, and policy-making.
    </p>

    <p>This discussion will introduce you to the <strong>GHO data APIs</strong> and provide hands-on experience in
        querying the data for analysis and comparison. With your understanding of SQL database design, data exchange
        standards, data security, and emerging data management trends, you will work with and
        interpret this real-world health data.</p>
