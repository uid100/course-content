    <h1>Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL)</h1>

    <p><strong>Structured Query Language (SQL)</strong> is a standardized programming language used to manage and
        manipulate relational databases. SQL was developed in the 1970s by IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald
        Chamberlin. It was originally called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) and was designed to retrieve and
        manipulate data stored in IBM's early relational database systems. SQL has since become the standard language
        for interacting with relational databases, and it is widely used in various industries for managing large
        volumes of data.</p>

    <h2>Why SQL is Used</h2>

    <p>SQL is essential for interacting with relational databases, which organize data into tables. It allows users to
        perform various operations such as querying data, updating records, and defining database structures. The
        simplicity and efficiency of SQL make it the go-to language for database management. SQL is also highly
        portable, meaning that queries written in SQL can be used across different database systems with minimal
        modification.</p>

    <h2>Sub-Languages of SQL</h2>

    <p>SQL is composed of several sub-languages, each with a specific purpose:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Definition Language (DDL):</strong> This sub-language is used to define and modify the
            structure of database objects, such as tables and indexes. Common DDL commands include <code>CREATE</code>,
            <code>ALTER</code>, and <code>DROP</code>.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Data Manipulation Language (DML):</strong> This sub-language is used to retrieve and manipulate data
            within the database. It includes commands like <code>SELECT</code>, <code>INSERT</code>,
            <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>DELETE</code>. These commands correspond to the CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
            Delete) operations in database management.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Data Control Language (DCL):</strong> This sub-language is used to control access to data within the
            database. It includes commands like <code>GRANT</code> and <code>REVOKE</code> that manage user permissions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Core DML Operations (CRUD)</h3>

    <p>The core DML operations that correspond to CRUD are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Create:</strong> <code>INSERT</code> - Adds new records to a table.</li>
        <li><strong>Read:</strong> <code>SELECT</code> - Retrieves data from a table.</li>
        <li><strong>Update:</strong> <code>UPDATE</code> - Modifies existing records in a table.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete:</strong> <code>DELETE</code> - Removes records from a table.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example: CRUD Operations in SQL</h2>

    <p>Below is a simple example demonstrating the basic CRUD operations in SQL:</p>

    <pre><code>-- Create a new table called 'Employees'
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Department VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert a new record into the 'Employees' table
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'HR');

-- Read data from the 'Employees' table
SELECT * FROM Employees;

-- Update a record in the 'Employees' table
UPDATE Employees
SET Department = 'Finance'
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;

-- Delete a record from the 'Employees' table
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
</code></pre>

    <p>This example demonstrates the basic SQL commands used to create a table, insert data into it, retrieve data,
        update existing records, and delete records from the table. These operations form the foundation of database
        management using SQL.</p>
