            Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate
            relational databases. SQL is used to create, modify, and query databases, as well as to define and enforce
            data integrity constraints.

        <h3>Some History and Background</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Structured Query Language (SQL) is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data
                held in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). SQL-like languages can also be used in
                Relational Data Stream Management Systems (RDSMS), or in “not-only SQL” (NoSQL) databases.
            </p>

            <p>
                SQL comprises of 3 major sub-languages:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Data Definition Language (DDL): to create and modify the structure of the database;</li>
                <li>Data Manipulation Language (DML): to perform Read, Insert, Update and Delete operations on the data
                    of the database;</li>
                <li>Data Control Language (DCL): to control the access of the data stored in the database.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL article on Wikipedia</a></p>

            <p>
                The core DML operations are Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD for short) which are performed by the
                statements INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is also a (recently added) MERGE statement which can perform all 3 write operations (INSERT,
                UPDATE,
                DELETE).
            </p>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD article on Wikipedia</a></p>

            <p>
                Many SQL databases are implemented as client/server systems; the term “SQL server” describes such a
                database.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the same time, Microsoft makes a database that is named “SQL Server”. While that database speaks a
                dialect of SQL, information specific to that database is not on topic in this tag but belongs into the
                SQL Server documentation.

            In this module, we will have a first look at the <strong>SELECT</strong> statement, which is used to query
            data
            from a database. The <strong>SELECT</strong> statement is the most commonly used statement in SQL and is
            used to
            retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. The <strong>SELECT</strong> statement is used to select
            data
            from a database and display the results in a table.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a lot more to know about designing and implementing databases, but for now, we will focus on the
            basics
            of SQL and the <strong>SELECT</strong> statement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the relevant tables and data are given in the examples for this module, it is important to
            understand
            that in a real-world scenario, you would have to design and implement the database yourself. This would
            involve
            creating the tables, defining the columns, and inserting the data. This requires an understanding of data
            constraints
            and relationships between tables.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data constraints are rules that are applied to the data in a table. These rules ensure the accuracy and
            reliability
            of the data. For example, a primary key constraint ensures that each row in a table is unique, while a
            foreign
            key
            constraint ensures that the values in a column match the values in another table.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll discuss these concepts in more detail in future modules, but for now, let's focus on the basics of SQL
            and
            the <strong>SELECT</strong> statement.
