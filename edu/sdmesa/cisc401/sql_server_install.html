            A new PC build image was used for this walk-through. No pre-existing software installations are on this
            (Windows 10 pro) system at the beginning of the install. These instructions and steps are subject to change,
            but are current as of this date.

            <li>Navigate to the Microsoft download link for SQL Server. Scroll down the page and find the link to
                download the Developer version of the product.<br />

            <li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Launch the downloaded installation utility,</li>
                    <li>Select the Basic installation,</li>
                    <li>Read and accept the license terms for the developer edition of SQL Server</li>
                    <li>Confirm the install location. In most cases, the default is recommended</li>
                    <li>Click the <b>[Install]</b> to begin</li>
                    </ul>
                    For reference, in my case, using a modest system configuration and relatively fast internet access,
                    the automated installation process, including acquiring the setup files, installing and configuring
                    the software completed in about 8-1/2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                At the <em>installation complete</em> screen, select the option to install SQL Server Management Studio
                <strong>[Install SSMS]</strong>. This will open a link in your browser to download the setup utility for
                SSMS. After downloading the setup utility file, close the browser and launch the file (<em>from your
                    downloads folder.</em>) Accept the defaul installation location and the install will typically take
                another 5 minutes or so.
