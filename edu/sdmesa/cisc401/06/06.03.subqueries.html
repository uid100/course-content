            <div class="card-header">Subqueries</div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <h1>Subqueries in SQL Server</h1>
                <p>
                    A <strong>subquery</strong> is a query nested inside another query. It allows you to perform a
                    query and use its result in another query. Subqueries can be placed in SELECT, WHERE, FROM, or other clauses to
                    refine or filter results. Essentially, subqueries are used to answer more complex questions by breaking them
                    into smaller, manageable parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like other SELECT queries you have seen, subqueries can return a single value, multiple values or table values
                </p>

                <h2>Types of Subqueries</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scalar Subquery</strong>: Returns a single value and is often used in SELECT or WHERE clauses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multivalue Subquery</strong>: Returns multiple values, such as a tuple.</li>
                    <li><strong>Table Subquery</strong>: Returns a result set and is typically used in the FROM clause (also called
                        a derived table).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Subqueries can also be categorized based on their relationship with the outer query:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Correlated Subquery</strong>: A subquery that references columns from the outer query and is
                        re-evaluated for each row of the outer query.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-correlated Subquery</strong> (or independent subquery): A subquery that can be evaluated
                        independently of the outer query
                </ul>

                <h2>When and Why Subqueries are Useful</h2>
                <p>
                    Subqueries may be useful when you need to perform intermediate calculations, filtering, or
                    lookups before performing the main query. For example, you might want to find the patients who have the most
                    appointments, or retrieve only the doctors with a certain specialty who have available appointments.
                </p>

                <h2>Example Use Cases</h2>

                <h3>1. Scalar Subquery</h3>
                <p>
                    You can use a subquery to find a single value, such as the maximum bill amount for a patient, and use it in the
                    main query.
                </p>
                <pre>
            SELECT Name, (SELECT MAX(BillAmount) FROM Billing WHERE Billing.PatientID = Patients.PatientID) AS MaxBill
            FROM Patients;
                </pre>
                <p>This query returns each patient's name along with the maximum bill amount for that patient.</p>

                <h3>2. Table Subquery</h3>
                <p>
                    A subquery can also be used to create a temporary result set (a derived table). For example, to find all
                    patients who have more than 3 appointments, we can first calculate the appointment count and use it in the outer
                    query.
                </p>
                <pre>
            SELECT Name
            FROM Patients
            WHERE PatientID IN (SELECT PatientID FROM Appointments GROUP BY PatientID HAVING COUNT(*) > 3);
                </pre>
                <p>This subquery counts appointments for each patient, and the main query retrieves patients with more than 3
                    appointments.</p>

                <h3>3. Correlated Subquery</h3>
                <p>
                    Correlated subqueries are more advanced and allow you to reference the outer query's data. For example, if you
                    want to find all appointments where the billing amount is higher than the average billing amount for that
                    specific patient:
                </p>
                <pre>
            SELECT AppointmentID, BillAmount
            FROM Billing AS b
            WHERE BillAmount > (SELECT AVG(BillAmount) FROM Billing WHERE PatientID = b.PatientID);
                </pre>
                <p>This query checks if the bill for each appointment is higher than the average bill for that patient.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    Subqueries allow you to answer complex questions in SQL by breaking them into smaller queries. In a medical
                    database, they can be used to filter data based on specific conditions, perform calculations, or make
                    comparisons that are not easily handled by a single query. Whether you need to analyze appointments, billing, or
                    doctor availability, subqueries are a powerful tool to enhance your SQL queries.
                </p>

                <h2>Practice Exercise</h2>
                <p>
                    Consider the following tables:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Students</strong>: Contains student information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Courses</strong>: Contains course details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enrollments</strong>: Contains data about student enrollments in courses.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Write SQL queries to answer the following questions:
                </p>

                    <summary>Find Students Enrolled in More Than 3 Courses</summary>
                    <p>
                        To find students who are enrolled in more than 3 courses, we can use a subquery to count the number of
                        enrollments for each student and filter the results accordingly:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            SELECT Name
            FROM Students
            WHERE StudentID IN (
                SELECT StudentID
                FROM Enrollments
                GROUP BY StudentID
                    HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
            );
                    </pre>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Find Courses with No Enrollments</summary>
                    <p>
                        To find courses with no enrollments, we can use a subquery to check if the course ID exists in the
                        Enrollments table:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            SELECT CourseName
            FROM Courses
            WHERE CourseID NOT IN (
                SELECT CourseID 
                FROM Enrollments
            );
                    </pre>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Find Students Enrolled in the Same Courses as a Specific Student</summary>
                    <p>
                        To find students who are enrolled in the same courses as a specific student (e.g., StudentID = 999), we can
                        use a subquery to get the list of courses for the specific student and compare it with other students'
                        course
                        lists:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
            SELECT Name
            FROM Students
            WHERE StudentID IN (
                SELECT StudentID
                FROM Enrollments
                WHERE CourseID IN (
                    SELECT CourseID
                    FROM Enrollments
                    WHERE StudentID = 999
                )
            );
                    </pre>
                </details>
