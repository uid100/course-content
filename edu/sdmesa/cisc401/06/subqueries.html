    <h1>Subqueries in SQL Server</h1>
    <p>
        A <strong>subquery</strong> is a query nested inside another query. It allows you to perform a
        query and use its result in another query. Subqueries can be placed in SELECT, WHERE, FROM, or other clauses to
        refine or filter results. Essentially, subqueries are used to answer more complex questions by breaking them
        into smaller, manageable parts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like other SELECT queries you have seen, subqueries can return a single value, multiple values or table values
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Subqueries</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scalar Subquery</strong>: Returns a single value and is often used in SELECT or WHERE clauses.</li>
        <li><strong>Multivalue Subquery</strong>: Returns multiple values, such as a tuple.</li>
        <li><strong>Table Subquery</strong>: Returns a result set and is typically used in the FROM clause (also called
            a derived table).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Subqueries can also be categorized based on their relationship with the outer query:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Correlated Subquery</strong>: A subquery that references columns from the outer query and is
            re-evaluated for each row of the outer query.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-correlated Subquery</strong> (or independent subquery): A subquery that can be evaluated
            independently of the outer query
    </ul>

    <h2>When and Why Subqueries are Useful</h2>
    <p>
        Subqueries may be useful when you need to perform intermediate calculations, filtering, or
        lookups before performing the main query. For example, you might want to find the patients who have the most
        appointments, or retrieve only the doctors with a certain specialty who have available appointments.
    </p>

    <h2>Example Use Cases</h2>

    <h3>1. Scalar Subquery</h3>
    <p>
        You can use a subquery to find a single value, such as the maximum bill amount for a patient, and use it in the
        main query.
    </p>
    <pre>
SELECT Name, (SELECT MAX(BillAmount) FROM Billing WHERE Billing.PatientID = Patients.PatientID) AS MaxBill
FROM Patients;
    </pre>
    <p>This query returns each patient's name along with the maximum bill amount for that patient.</p>

    <h3>2. Table Subquery</h3>
    <p>
        A subquery can also be used to create a temporary result set (a derived table). For example, to find all
        patients who have more than 3 appointments, we can first calculate the appointment count and use it in the outer
        query.
    </p>
    <pre>
SELECT Name
FROM Patients
WHERE PatientID IN (SELECT PatientID FROM Appointments GROUP BY PatientID HAVING COUNT(*) > 3);
    </pre>
    <p>This subquery counts appointments for each patient, and the main query retrieves patients with more than 3
        appointments.</p>

    <h3>3. Correlated Subquery</h3>
    <p>
        Correlated subqueries are more advanced and allow you to reference the outer query's data. For example, if you
        want to find all appointments where the billing amount is higher than the average billing amount for that
        specific patient:
    </p>
    <pre>
SELECT AppointmentID, BillAmount
FROM Billing AS b
WHERE BillAmount > (SELECT AVG(BillAmount) FROM Billing WHERE PatientID = b.PatientID);
    </pre>
    <p>This query checks if the bill for each appointment is higher than the average bill for that patient.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Subqueries allow you to answer complex questions in SQL by breaking them into smaller queries. In a medical
        database, they can be used to filter data based on specific conditions, perform calculations, or make
        comparisons that are not easily handled by a single query. Whether you need to analyze appointments, billing, or
        doctor availability, subqueries are a powerful tool to enhance your SQL queries.
    </p>

    <h2>Practice Exercise</h2>
    <p>
        Consider the following tables:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Students</strong>: Contains student information.</li>
        <li><strong>Courses</strong>: Contains course details.</li>
        <li><strong>Enrollments</strong>: Contains data about student enrollments in courses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Write SQL queries to answer the following questions:
    </p>

    <details>
        <summary>Find Students Enrolled in More Than 3 Courses</summary>
        <p>
            To find students who are enrolled in more than 3 courses, we can use a subquery to count the number of
            enrollments for each student and filter the results accordingly:
        </p>
        <pre>
SELECT Name
FROM Students
WHERE StudentID IN (
    SELECT StudentID
    FROM Enrollments
    GROUP BY StudentID
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
);
        </pre>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Find Courses with No Enrollments</summary>
        <p>
            To find courses with no enrollments, we can use a subquery to check if the course ID exists in the
            Enrollments table:
        </p>
        <pre>
SELECT CourseName
FROM Courses
WHERE CourseID NOT IN (
    SELECT CourseID 
    FROM Enrollments
);
        </pre>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Find Students Enrolled in the Same Courses as a Specific Student</summary>
        <p>
            To find students who are enrolled in the same courses as a specific student (e.g., StudentID = 999), we can
            use a subquery to get the list of courses for the specific student and compare it with other students'
            course
            lists:
        </p>
        <pre>
SELECT Name
FROM Students
WHERE StudentID IN (
    SELECT StudentID
    FROM Enrollments
    WHERE CourseID IN (
        SELECT CourseID
        FROM Enrollments
        WHERE StudentID = 999
    )
);
        </pre>
    </details>
