    <h1>Understanding Table JOINs</h1>
    <p>
        In SQL Server, a <strong>table JOIN</strong> is a way to combine data from two or more tables based on a related
        column between them.
    </p>
    <p>
        This allows us to query information that is spread across multiple tables. Joins are
        essential when we need to analyze or report on data that is stored separately for efficiency or organization.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Joins</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>INNER JOIN</strong>: Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.</li>
        <li><strong>OUTER JOINs</strong>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)</strong>: Returns all rows from the left table and the
                    matching rows
                    from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned from the right table.</li>
                <li><strong>RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)</strong>: Returns all rows from the right table and the
                    matching
                    rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned from the left table.</li>
                <li><strong>FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)</strong>: Returns all rows when there is a match in either
                    left or
                    right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>CROSS JOIN</strong>: Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, i.e., all possible
            combinations of rows from both tables.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When and Why Joins are Useful</h2>
    <p>
        In a medical database, information is often stored in different tables to avoid duplication and to make
        data
        management more efficient. For example, we might have the following tables:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Patients</strong>: Stores patient details.</li>
        <li><strong>Doctors</strong>: Stores doctor information.</li>
        <li><strong>Appointments</strong>: Contains data about appointments between patients and doctors.</li>
        <li><strong>Billing</strong>: Stores billing information for patient appointments.</li>
        <li><strong>Insurance</strong>: Contains insurance details for patients.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To get a complete view of a patient's visit, including the doctor they saw, their billing information,
        and their
        insurance details, we need to <strong>join</strong> these tables together.
    </p>

    <h2>Example Use Cases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>INNER JOIN</strong>: When we want to find all appointments where there is matching data for
            both the
            patient and doctor.</li>
        <pre>
SELECT Patients.Name, Doctors.Name, Appointments.Date
FROM Patients
INNER JOIN Appointments ON Patients.PatientID = Appointments.PatientID
INNER JOIN Doctors ON Appointments.DoctorID = Doctors.DoctorID;
        </pre>

        <li><strong>LEFT JOIN</strong>: When we want a list of all patients, along with their appointments (if
            any).
            Even if a patient has no appointments, they will still appear in the result.</li>
        <pre>
SELECT Patients.Name, Appointments.Date
FROM Patients
LEFT JOIN Appointments ON Patients.PatientID = Appointments.PatientID;
        </pre>

        <li><strong>RIGHT JOIN</strong>: When we want to see all doctors, including those who may not have any
            appointments yet.</li>
        <pre>
SELECT Doctors.Name, Appointments.Date
FROM Doctors
RIGHT JOIN Appointments ON Doctors.DoctorID = Appointments.DoctorID;
        </pre>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practice Exercise</h2>
    <p>
        Consider the following tables:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Students</strong>: Contains student information.</li>
        <li><strong>Courses</strong>: Contains course details.</li>
        <li><strong>Enrollments</strong>: Contains data about student enrollments in courses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Write SQL queries to answer the following questions:
    </p>

    <details>
        <summary>Find the names of all students who are enrolled in the course "CISC 401"</summary>
        <p>
            To find the names of all students enrolled in the course "CISC 401", we need to join the Students and
            Enrollments tables with the Courses table. The query would look like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
SELECT Students.Name
FROM Students
INNER JOIN Enrollments ON Students.StudentID = Enrollments.StudentID
INNER JOIN Courses ON Enrollments.CourseID = Courses.CourseID
WHERE Courses.CourseName = 'CISC 401';
        </pre>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Find the names of all students who are not enrolled in any course</summary>
        <p>
            To find the names of all students who are not enrolled in any course, we can use a LEFT JOIN between the
            Students and Enrollments tables and filter out the rows where the EnrollmentID is NULL (indicating no
            enrollment):
        </p>
        <pre>
SELECT Students.Name
FROM Students
LEFT JOIN Enrollments ON Students.StudentID = Enrollments.StudentID
WHERE Enrollments.EnrollmentID IS NULL;
        </pre>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Find the names of all courses along with the number of students enrolled in each course</summary>
        <p>
            To find the names of all courses along with the number of students enrolled in each course, we need to
            join the Courses and Enrollments tables and use an aggregate function to count the number of students:
        </p>
        <pre>
SELECT Courses.CourseName, COUNT(Enrollments.StudentID) AS NumStudents
FROM Courses
LEFT JOIN Enrollments ON Courses.CourseID = Enrollments.CourseID
GROUP BY Courses.CourseName;
        </pre>
    </details>
