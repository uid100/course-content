        <h1>Using table JOINs and subqueries</h1>
        <p>
            In SQL, data is often stored across multiple related tables, and querying data from these tables
            simultaneously is essential for complex database operations. Two common techniques to achieve this are
            <strong>JOIN</strong>s and <strong>subqueries</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="alert alert-info">JOINs</h2>
        <p>
            A JOIN is a SQL operation that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column, such as
            a shared foreign key. There are several types of JOINs, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>INNER JOIN</strong>: Returns only the rows with matching values in both tables.</li>
            <li><strong>LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)</strong>: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows
                from
                the right table; unmatched rows from the right are returned as NULL.</li>
            <li><strong>RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)</strong>: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows
                from
                the left; unmatched rows from the left are returned as NULL.</li>
            <li><strong>FULL OUTER JOIN</strong>: Returns all rows from both tables, with NULLs where there are no
                matches.</li>
            <li><strong>CROSS JOIN</strong>: Returns the Cartesian product of two tables (all possible combinations of
                rows).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            JOINs are used to retrieve data from multiple tables based on a related column between them. They are
            essential for querying complex relationships and fetching data that spans multiple tables.
        </p>
        <h2 class="alert alert-info">Subqueries</h2>
        <p>
            A subquery is a query nested inside another query, often used to filter, aggregate, or calculate data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Subqueries can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Return a single value (scalar subqueries).</li>
            <li>Return a list of values (used with IN or EXISTS).</li>
            <li>Be used in the FROM clause as a derived table.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Subqueries are powerful when you need to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compare aggregated data to individual rows.</li>
            <li>Fetch related data indirectly or with complex conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Both joins and subqueries are fundamental for efficiently querying multi-table relationships, allowing you
            to
            retrieve meaningful and relevant data.
