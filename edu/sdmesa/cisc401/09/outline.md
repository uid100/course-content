### **Lesson Structure**

#### 1. **Introduction to SQL in Healthcare (10 minutes)**
   - **Overview**: The importance of SQL in healthcare systems for managing large amounts of data, ensuring data integrity, and supporting decision-making.
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Electronic Health Records (EHR)
     - Common healthcare databases (HL7, FHIR, etc.)
     - Use cases: patient data analysis, claims management, and report generation.

#### 2. **Topic 1: Writing Complex Queries for Healthcare Scenarios (30 minutes)**
   - **Objective**: Understand how to write efficient SQL queries for various healthcare-related scenarios such as patient demographics, appointment scheduling, and medical records.
   - **Subtopics**:
     - **Joins & Subqueries**:
       - How to combine patient records with appointment data, lab results, and billing information.
       - **Example**: Retrieve patient information along with their most recent lab results.
     - **Aggregate Functions**:
       - Calculate averages, counts, and sums for healthcare metrics.
       - **Example**: Find the average length of hospital stays by department.
     - **Window Functions**:
       - How to track patient trends over time, e.g., glucose level progression.
       - **Example**: Calculate rolling averages for patient vitals.
   - **Hands-on Exercise**: 
     - Participants will write a query to fetch patient demographics who have visited the clinic in the past month, along with their recent diagnoses and lab results.

#### 3. **Topic 2: Creating and Managing Healthcare Reports (30 minutes)**
   - **Objective**: Learn how to create reports for hospital administrators and healthcare providers using SQL.
   - **Subtopics**:
     - **Report Types**:
       - Operational Reports (e.g., bed occupancy rate)
       - Financial Reports (e.g., billing by insurance provider)
       - Clinical Reports (e.g., patient discharge summaries)
     - **Grouping and Filtering**:
       - Using `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and date filters to generate periodical reports.
       - **Example**: Create a report showing the number of patients admitted by department each month.
     - **Using Views**:
       - Simplify report creation by using SQL Views for reusable queries.
     - **Exporting Data**:
       - Exporting query results into formats like CSV for further use in external reporting tools.
   - **Hands-on Exercise**: 
     - Participants will generate a report showing the number of patients admitted, discharged, and transferred during the last 6 months, broken down by ward.

#### 4. **Topic 3: SQL Best Practices for Healthcare Applications (20 minutes)**
   - **Objective**: Understand best practices for managing healthcare data efficiently and securely in SQL-based systems.
   - **Subtopics**:
     - **Data Privacy and Security**:
       - Handling sensitive data (HIPAA, GDPR compliance).
       - **Tip**: Avoid using actual patient data during testing; use anonymized or synthetic data.
     - **Indexing and Query Optimization**:
       - How to speed up queries involving large datasets (e.g., lab results or billing records).
       - **Tip**: Use indexes on frequently searched columns like patient IDs.
     - **Error Handling and Validation**:
       - How to handle null values, outliers, and inconsistent data in healthcare datasets.
       - **Tip**: Always validate data before inserting or updating records.
   - **Hands-on Exercise**: 
     - Optimize an existing SQL query to reduce execution time by adding appropriate indexes.

#### 5. **Case Study: Analyzing Patient Data with SQL (25 minutes)**
   - **Objective**: Apply all learned skills in a real-world scenario involving patient data analysis.
   - **Scenario**: A hospital wants to analyze patient readmission rates and find patterns in the most common diagnoses for readmitted patients.
   - **Steps**:
     - Retrieve patients readmitted within 30 days of discharge.
     - Analyze common diagnoses among those patients.
     - Track which departments have the highest readmission rates.
   - **Hands-on Exercise**:
     - Write a query to analyze patient readmission rates and produce a summary of the most frequent reasons for readmission.
     - Create a report for hospital administration highlighting high-risk departments based on patient data.

#### 6. **Q&A and Review (15 minutes)**
   - Recap key learning points from the session.
   - Open floor for participant questions.
   - Discussion on the challenges of using SQL in healthcare environments and potential solutions.

---

#### 7. **Assignment (Optional for Follow-up)**
   - Create a more complex report on patient outcomes based on a sample database (e.g., track recovery rates based on treatments).
   - Participants will write and submit queries that address a healthcare-related question of their choice.

---

### **Materials Needed**:
   - Pre-prepared healthcare dataset (anonymized).
   - SQL environment (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server).
   - Sample queries for demonstration.
   - Slide deck summarizing key concepts.

### **Assessment**:
   - Participation in hands-on exercises.
   - Ability to apply SQL skills to create complex queries and generate reports.
   - Demonstrated understanding of SQL best practices in healthcare.
