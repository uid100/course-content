  <h1>SQL in Healthcare</h1>
  <p>
    Databases and SQL are used exensively in healthcare systems for managing large
    amounts of data, ensuring data integrity, and supporting decision-making.
  </p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Electronic Health Records (EHR)</li>
    <li>Common healthcare databases (HL7, FHIR, etc.)</li>
    <li>Other uses, such as patient data analysis, claims management, and report generation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Complex SQL queries - Concepts</h2>
  <p>
    Writing complex queries for healthcare scenarios involves understanding how to
    combine data from multiple tables, use aggregate functions, and apply window functions
    for tracking trends over time.
  </p>
  <h3>Review</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Joins & Subqueries: Combining patient records with appointment data, lab results, and billing information.</li>
    <li>Aggregate Functions: Calculating averages, counts, and sums for healthcare metrics.</li>
    <li>Window Functions: Tracking patient trends over time, e.g., glucose level progression.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Creating and Managing Healthcare Reports</h2>
  <p>Create reports for hospital administrators and healthcare providers using SQL.</p>
  <p>Reports are essential for monitoring patient care, resource utilization, and financial
    performance.</p>
  <h3>Types of Reports</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Operational Reports (e.g., bed occupancy rate)</li>
    <li>Financial Reports (e.g., billing by insurance provider)</li>
    <li>Clinical Reports (e.g., patient discharge summaries)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Creating Reports with SQL</h3>
  <p>
    Reports are commonly created using SQL tools, from SELECT queries with JOIN clauses to
    integrate data from multiple tables and using more advanced GROUP BY and HAVING clauses for
    aggregating data.
  </p>
  <h3>more reporting examples</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a report showing the number of patients admitted by department each month.</li>
    <li>Export query results into formats like CSV for further use in external
      reporting and visualization tools.</li>
