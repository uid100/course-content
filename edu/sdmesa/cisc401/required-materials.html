                California Community Colleges (CCC) has a shared goal supported by the Zero-Textbook-Cost
                (ZTC) program to “reduce the overall cost of education for students and decrease the time it
                takes students to complete degree programs offered by community colleges.”

                There are many excellent references and textbooks available to help students learn this
                subject, and this course will require some study and research initiative, but the study
                materials required and recommended for the class will rely on publicly available and open
                source resources.

                We will be demonstrating and exercising database ecosystems including SQLite (open source)
                and Microsoft SQL Server and exploring various access mechanisms. All of these tools are
                either public domain or licensed at no cost for student use.

                In most cases, classroom computers will be configured with all relevant software and tools.
                Where applicable, installation of any or all of these to student-provided personal computers
                is allowed and will be discussed and described in class. Installation of these prior to
                class is not required or suggested.
