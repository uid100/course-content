    <h2>Course Preparation</h2>
    <p>To ensure students can succeed and get the most out of this course, they should
        ideally possess the following foundational knowledge and skills.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Basic Computer Literacy</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Comfort with using computers and navigating the internet.</li>
            <li>Understanding of file management (creating, saving, and organizing files and folders).</li>
            <li>Experience using basic software applications (e.g., text editors, web browsers).</li>
            <li>Ability to install and run software applications.</li>
            <li>Ability to open and navigate the command-line interface (CLI) or terminal and familiarity with simple
                file system commands such as:
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>changing directory <code>cd</code></li>
                    <li>listing files <code>ls (or dir)</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <li>Understanding of Logical Thinking</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic problem-solving skills.</li>
            <li>Familiarity with concepts like sequences, decisions, and loops (even at a conceptual level, such as
                understanding "if this happens, then do that").</li>
            <li>Ability to break tasks into smaller, manageable steps (algorithmic thinking).</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Basic Math Skills</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic problem-solving skills.</li>
            <li>Familiarity with concepts like sequences, decisions, and loops (even at a conceptual level, such as
                understanding "if this happens, then do that").</li>
            <li>Ability to break tasks into smaller, manageable steps (algorithmic thinking).</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Basic Math Skills</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Understanding of fundamental arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
            </li>
            <li>Familiarity with basic mathematical concepts like variables, percentages, and simple equations.</li>
            <li>Comfort with interpreting and solving word problems.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Exposure to Tools (Optional but Beneficial)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic experience with using command-line interfaces (CLI) or terminal commands.</li>
            <li>Awareness of text editors or integrated development environments (IDEs), such as VS Code, Sublime Text,
                or even Notepad.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Exposure to Technical Concepts (Optional but Helpful)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Familiarity with what programming is and how it relates to software and applications.</li>
            <li>Basic understanding of what data is (numbers, text, and files) and how it can be used in programs.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Soft Skills</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Curiosity and willingness to learn: Programming often involves figuring out why something doesnâ€™t work.
            </li>
            <li>Patience and persistence: Debugging and solving coding problems can take time and effort.</li>
            <li>Attention to detail: Understanding that small errors (like a missing comma) can cause issues in a
                program.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h2>Additional Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
        While not strictly necessary, students who have exposure to other programming or scripting environments, such as
        HTML or Scratch, may find it easier to grasp Python concepts quickly.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        These prerequisites ensure that students can focus on learning Python itself without being overwhelmed by
        unfamiliar tools or foundational concepts.
