            Integrate graphics in menus and forms
        </li>
        <li>
            Write, test, debug, and document Python event procedure coding
        </li>
        <li>
            Determine the event procedure required to develop a Windows application after the visual interfaces
            have been developed
        </li>
        <li>
            Use data files to save and retrieve data to a secondary storage device
        </li>
        <li>
            Create and demonstrate the conversion of programs into executable and/or web-enabled applications
        </li>
        <li>
            Complete procedural design documentation necessary to code Python programs
        </li>
        <li>
            Systematically design and implement introductory-level Python programs from given specifications,
            such as problem descriptions, user stories, design criteria, input/output scenarios, functional or unit
            tests, pseudo code, modeling language specifications or diagrams.
        </li>
        <li>
            Articulate the purpose and working of a introductory-level Python program, and its language
            constructs and data structures, such as through diagrams (for instance, flowcharts, Unified Modelling
            Language (UML) diagrams or entity-relationship (ER) diagrams), code comments, screencast videos,
            interactive computing notebooks (for instance, Jupyter notebooks), or written or oral communication.
        </li>
        <li>
            Document external interfaces of introductory-level Python functions and methods (the application
            programming interface (API)), and the inner working of introductory-level Python functions and
            methods by in-code comments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Systematically test and debug introductory-level Python programs required to validate Python
            programs by interactively entering arguments, utilizing functional or unit tests, running programs in a
            test environment, or using a debug environment (for instance, a debugger in an integrated development
            environment (IDE)).
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop introductory-level Python programs using industry recognized tools, such as code editors,
            command lines (Read, execute, print loop, REPL), emulators, or integrated development environments
            (IDE).
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a fully functional, interactive introductory-level Python program incorporating a substantial
            set of topics from the course.
        </li>
    </ol>
